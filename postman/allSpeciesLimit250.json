With the proper training that she missed out on as a younger pup, she will be a great addition to the family!\n\nNGPR Pooch Profile \n\nName: Sasha in OH\n\nAge: 1 yr&nbsp;7 mos old as of Apr 2021\n\nColor: white\n\nDew Claws: yes double\n\nEstimated Adult Weight: 85 lbs\n\nCurrent Location: NGPR approved foster in Springfield, OH\n\nMedical:  To be spayed, dewormed, negative for heartworm, up-to-date on vaccinations and currently on flea, tick and heartworm preventative. This dog travels with a Interstate Health Certificate required by the USDA confirming that all the above criteria have been met.\n\nHousebroken: yes\n\nCan be Placed With: Older Kids, Cats, Other Dogs\n\nFencing: Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nFees: Adoption Fee $325 - $550 depending on age and location; transport included.\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a  guardian by nature  and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant&rsquo;s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority. \n\nIf you can&#39;t foster or adopt at this time, please consider helping our Neediest Cases.\n\nPlease visit our ADOPTION CENTER to complete the application form and learn more about Pyrs and our adoption process. Thanks. \nAbout Us: National Great Pyrenees Rescue (NGPR) is not a shelter. We are a not-for-profit, tax-exempt coalition of Pyr rescuers and rescue groups. We save Pyrs and Pyr mixes across the country and place them in approved foster homes so we know how they will interact with \nyour\nfamily. Please consider adopting or fostering.  Every dog who is fostered or adopted makes room for another Pyr coming out of a kill shelter.  Prior to adoption, NGPR dogs are fostered for a minimum of two weeks (usually more), spayed or neutered and fully vetted. Dogs coming from out of area are certified with a USDA health certificate before going to their new homes. Our rescuers adhere to the highest placement standards and will  take back any dog  whose adoption does not succeed. Visit www.nationalpyr.org to learn more about us, our mission and our breed.\nMore Information: Questions? The fastest way to learn more about a dog is to fill out the application form below. If you call or e-mail you are reducing your chances of adopting this animal as we direct our time and energy to first serving those who apply. For more information about our adoption process please visit our  adoption information page.\nWant to help but can&rsquo;t adopt now?

He is not quite sure what to make of the stairs indoors yet, but he seems to navigate the ones outdoors with ease. Cheb likes to spend most of his day napping in various parts of the house, being the most pyrfect work from home companion. He likes to stretch his legs in the afternoons, preferably a nice stroll around the neighborhood just to make sure everything is in order.

Having retired from a lifetime of farm duties, Cheb is looking for a quiet home to rest his bones, and to enjoy all the love he deserves. Although Cheb has not lived inside a house his whole life, he has excellent house manners and is a pyrfect gentleman in his foster home. He is not quite sure what to make of the stairs indoors yet, but he seems to navigate the ones outdoors with ease. Cheb likes to spend most of his day napping in various parts of the house, being the most pyrfect work from home companion. He likes to stretch his legs in the afternoons, preferably a nice stroll around the neighborhood just to make sure everything is in order. Cheb is the definition of a gentle giant - he gets along well with laid back dogs but can get grumpy with felines so we recommend no cats. He is a tad shy, given his limited interactions with people in his past, but he truly adores a good scratch behind the ears and a nice long belly rub :) If you enjoy a quiet lifestyle and have plenty of love to spare, Cheb may be the pyrfect companion for you!\n\nNGPR Pooch Profile \n\nName: Cheb in PA\n\nAge: 11 yrs 4 mos old as of June 2021\n\nColor: White\n\nDew Claws: Double\n\nEstimated Adult Weight: 90 lbs\n\nCurrent Location: NGPR approved foster in Palmyra, PA\n\nMedical:  Neutered, dewormed, up-to-date on vaccinations and currently on flea, tick, and heartworm preventative.

You'd never know he ever had an issue by the way he gallops!&nbsp;\nDoug is a recent graduate of our prison training program and now knows his basic commands. He's also crate trained and fully house trained. He's SUPER sweet, loves to be affectionate with his humans, and LOVES to play with other dogs. He's curious about cats, but not aggressive. He's also very good with kids, but is still puppy-like in a lot of ways, so if your kids are experienced with dogs, then they'd be fine.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nIf you are interested in adopting Doug, please submit an application on our website, www.prodogsohio.org\/adoptables. He's been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and his adoption fee is $300.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nPlease note, we only schedule meet and greets with approved applicants, as we are all volunteers and do not have a facility for you to visit our dogs. If you have questions about Doug that are not answered in this bio, please email info@prodogsohio.org.

He most likely will thrive&nbsp;in a home with no young children under the age of 10 years old&nbsp;and with a dog that is of calmer temperament. His forever pawrents must also be comfortable with his growls because he is a&nbsp;talkative dog - albeit all&nbsp;bark and no bite. He just likes to &quot;trash talk&quot; He favors men and possibly&nbsp;older women. His foster mum says, &quot;He&#39;s so funny because he seems to not like me too much because he growls at me the most. He&#39;ll come and growl when I put ear drops or his belly band but won&#39;t walk away from me and will instead lean in for scratchies. He&#39;s very loving, sweet and a really good cuddler. He&#39;s hefty so he&#39;s extra nice to cuddle with. He&#39;s got these beautiful, soulful eyes that seem to speak to you and everyone in the house loves him so so much.&quot;&nbsp; Bobo is on a special diet due to allergies and must remain on that diet. Bobo has done really well with housetraining on a schedule. He enjoys car rides and walks with his foster bros.&nbsp;","isDogsOk":true,"earType":"Droopy","energyLevel":"Low","exerciseNeeds":"Low","eyeColor":"Brown","fenceNeeds":"Not Required","isNeedingFoster":false,"isFound":false,"groomingNeeds":"High","priority":10,"indoorOutdoor":"Indoor Only","isKidsOk":false,"name":"Bobo - OS","newPeopleReaction":"Friendly","obedienceTraining":"Has Basic Training","ownerExperience":"Breed","pictureCount":5,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4697\/pictures\/animals\/16870\/16870142\/79902380_100x77.jpg","qualities":["affectionate","eagerToPlease","doesWellInCar","goofy","hasAllergies","intelligent","lap","leashtrained","noLargeDogs","obedient","oKForSeniors","olderKidsOnly","playful","specialDiet"],"rescueId":"4697","searchString":"Bobo - OS   White with Black Male Small 4697  Dogs Lhasa Apso \/ Shih Tzu \/ Mixed (long coat)s","sex":"Male","sheddingLevel":"None","sizeCurrent":22,"sizeGroup":"Small","sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-bobo-os-lhasa-apso-dog","isSpecialNeeds":true,"isSponsorable":false,"tailType":"Curled","url":"https:\/\/ohiofuzzypawz.rescuegroups.org\/animals\/detail?AnimalID=16870142","videoCount":0,"videoUrlCount":0,"vocalLevel":"Some","isYardRequired":false,"createdDate":"2021-06-08T18:18:15Z","updatedDate":"2021-07-28T14:22:55Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"79902380"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79902379"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79902381"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79902384"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79902396"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"4697"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"163"},{"type":"breeds","id":"201"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"8"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"16878575","attributes":{"distance":11.84,"activityLevel":"Slightly Active","isAdoptionPending":false,"ageGroup":"Adult","ageString":"6 Years 2 Months","birthDate":"2015-05-20T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Domestic Short Hair \/ Mixed (short coat)","breedPrimary":"Domestic Short Hair","breedPrimaryId":35,"isBreedMixed":true,"isCatsOk":true,"coatLength":"Short","isCourtesyListing":false,"isDeclawed":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p>\n<span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;\">I used to be an angry cat and would swat and hiss.

Our adoption fees are $75.- for kittens (6 months and younger), $65.- for cats, $45.- for Wise Whiskers (7 years and older). We often have adoption specials where the adoption fees are lowered. The adoption fee includes the animals already being spayed\/neutered, Feline Leukemia tested (cats), Heartworm tested (cats and dogs), all vaccinations (FVRCP and DHLPP), rabies vaccine (if kittens or puppies adopted are not old enough to have received a rabies vaccine, then the new owner can bring them back for that at no extra cost), microchip, flea\/tick\/heartworm preventative.","about":"We are a 501c3, non-profit, all volunteer animal rescue and welfare organization.

We do this because there is an epidemic of abused, neglected, abandoned animals throughout Central Ohio. As a compassionate organization we are striving to end this suffering for them.

Adopters also commit to providing regular veterinary care.  All rabbits are spayed\/neutered before being adopted.  In addition, the primary caregiver must be an adult. If the adopter cannot care for their rabbit, they must return it to Ohio House Rabbit Rescue.\n\nTo adopt a rabbit, potential adopters must first fill out an application for a rabbit they are interested in. Then, they are interviewed by OHRR Adoption Coordinators. If their application is approved and interview is successful, they sign a contract stating that they understand our expectations for the care of their rabbit(s), that they will notify Ohio House Rabbit Rescue when the rabbit dies, and that they understand that OHRR reserves the right to remove the rabbit if we feel his\/her life is endangered or if there is a violation of the adoption policy.  OHRR delivers all rabbits to the home of the adopter to help the adopter set-up their new rabbit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s space and help with additional rabbit-proofing.  This also helps OHRR to ensure that all rabbit housing is appropriate.  \n\nTo adopt a single rabbit the fee is $40.  A bonded pair is $60. ","about":"Ohio House Rabbit Rescue is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated rescuing and adopting indoor pet rabbits. Our mission is to establish and operate a Center for rescued abandoned pet rabbits, offer a robust adoption program and provide educational resources and programming on the proper care of rabbits as indoor companions.  OHRR envisions a community where all pet rabbits live indoors as companions and have access to a proper diet, habitat, and regular veterinary care for the duration of their life.\n\nOHRR was founded in 2009 by longtime rabbit owner, Beverly May.  After realizing that over 900 rabbits were offered for surrender each year in Central Ohio alone, Beverly decided that Ohio needed a rescue and adoption center for rabbits.  OHRR began with an extensive network of foster homes in order to begin rescuing rabbits and to build community support. In 2013, OHRR opened the Ohio House Rabbit Adoption Center, which is the first rescue and adoption center in Ohio that is exclusively for rabbits. In 2013, we founds homes for over 70 bunnies.\n\nIn addition to our adoptions program, OHRR hosts Midwest BunFest, the largest rabbit-related exposition in the Eastern United States. BunFest includes shopping from various small animal supply vendors, the Bunny Spa with nail trips and grooming, Bunny Glamour Shots pet photography, a chance to interact with rabbit rescues across the Midwest, and also has over 10 education sessions from nationally recognized veterinarians and certified rabbit educators. In 2012, OHRR developed the Fix-a-Bun (FAB) Low-Cost Spay\/Neuter program that provides assistance in paying for spay\/neuter surgery for rabbits in Ohio, and the program has helped many families pay for spay\/neuter surgery. Further, OHRR attends adoption events at local pet supply stores on an ongoing basis and hosts community fundraisers quarterly. OHRR also provides email and telephone support to rabbit owners across Ohio and in other states.\n","services":"Adoptions program, low-cost spay\/neuter, bunny educational events and community
