He would not be good with another territorial male or cats.

A home where I can be the sole shining canine star would be ideal.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been described as very affectionate, (I love cuddles!), sensitive, and mostly submissive. I can be insecure when it comes to loud noises, such as thunderstorms and fireworks. My future owners will need to be patient and kind, and continue with my training and socialization.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m a sweet girl who is longing for a home where I&rsquo;ll never be left behind again.

I&rsquo;m house trained, leash trained and crate trained.\nI love as much positive attention as possible, (who doesn&rsquo;t?) and am not certain I want to share your affection with other animals. I like Nylabones, Kong toys and real bones but have a hard time sharing such treats with canine buddies. (I never got any before I was rescued.) A home where I can be the sole shining canine star would be ideal.\nI&rsquo;ve been described as very affectionate, (I love cuddles!), sensitive, and mostly submissive. I can be insecure when it comes to loud noises, such as thunderstorms and fireworks. My future owners will need to be patient and kind, and continue with my training and socialization.\nI&rsquo;m a sweet girl who is longing for a home where I&rsquo;ll never be left behind again. Can you help me complete my journey and make my dreams of a loving home come true?\nFor more information or questions, email Tim at&nbsp;tmb611@msn.com.\n","isDogsOk":false,"isNeedingFoster":false,"isFound":false,"priority":5,"isHousetrained":true,"isKidsOk":false,"name":"Ellie","pictureCount":25,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3182\/pictures\/animals\/5654\/5654280\/51376826_100x113.jpg","qualities":["hasAllergies"],"rescueId":"D130408","searchString":"Ellie   Brindle Female Medium D130408  Dogs American Pit Bull Terrier \/ Mixed (short coat)s","sex":"Female","sizeCurrent":44,"sizeGroup":"Medium","sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-ellie-american-pit-bull-terrier-dog","isSpecialNeeds":false,"isSponsorable":true,"sponsorshipMinimum":"1.00","url":"https:\/\/lddr.rescuegroups.org\/animals\/detail?AnimalID=5654280","videoCount":0,"videoUrlCount":2,"createdDate":"2013-05-15T01:41:45Z","updatedDate":"2021-02-26T16:20:47Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"51376826"},{"type":"pictures","id":"63044710"},{"type":"pictures","id":"63044711"},{"type":"pictures","id":"63044712"},{"type":"pictures","id":"40410485"},{"type":"pictures","id":"54390726"},{"type":"pictures","id":"42166712"},{"type":"pictures","id":"42166713"},{"type":"pictures","id":"42166714"},{"type":"pictures","id":"42166715"},{"type":"pictures","id":"35143293"},{"type":"pictures","id":"35143290"},{"type":"pictures","id":"35143291"},{"type":"pictures","id":"35143294"},{"type":"pictures","id":"35143295"},{"type":"pictures","id":"23834321"},{"type":"pictures","id":"26543363"},{"type":"pictures","id":"26543387"},{"type":"pictures","id":"26543365"},{"type":"pictures","id":"24686176"},{"type":"pictures","id":"16254185"},{"type":"pictures","id":"16651910"},{"type":"pictures","id":"16254189"},{"type":"pictures","id":"16067489"},{"type":"pictures","id":"16254183"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"3182"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"729"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"8"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"5663087","attributes":{"activityLevel":"Moderately Active","isAdoptionPending":false,"ageGroup":"Senior","ageString":"7 Years 8 Months","birthDate":"2012-11-17T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Shepherd \/ Labrador Retriever \/ Mixed (short coat)","breedPrimary":"Shepherd","breedPrimaryId":411,"breedSecondary":"Labrador Retriever","breedSecondaryId":162,"isBreedMixed":true,"isCatsOk":false,"coatLength":"Short","isCourtesyListing":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p>This girl is a very shy dog.&nbsp; She has not had a lot of socialization.&nbsp; She will need a home with someone that has some dog training experience and a lot of patience.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t recommend her with kids or cats.<\/p><img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?5663087\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","descriptionText":"This girl is a very shy dog.&nbsp; She has not had a lot of socialization.&nbsp; She will need a home with someone that has some dog training experience and a lot of patience.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t recommend her with kids or cats.","isDogsOk":false,"energyLevel":"Moderate","exerciseNeeds":"Moderate","fenceNeeds":"6 foot","isNeedingFoster":false,"isFound":false,"groomingNeeds":"Low","priority":10,"indoorOutdoor":"Indoor and Outdoor","isKidsOk":false,"name":"Little Girl 1","newPeopleReaction":"Cautious","obedienceTraining":"Needs Training","ownerExperience":"Species","pictureCount":1,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5152\/pictures\/animals\/5663\/5663087\/16087178_100x115.jpg","qualities":["skittish","timid"],"sex":"Female","sheddingLevel":"Moderate","sizeGroup":"Medium","sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-little-girl-shepherd-dog","isSpecialNeeds":false,"isSponsorable":false,"videoCount":0,"videoUrlCount":0,"vocalLevel":"Quiet","isYardRequired":true,"createdDate":"2013-05-16T22:24:59Z","updatedDate":"2020-04-19T20:33:03Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"16087178"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"5152"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"411"},{"type":"breeds","id":"162"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"8"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"5663102","attributes":{"activityLevel":"Moderately Active","isAdoptionPending":false,"adultSexesOk":"All","ageGroup":"Adult","ageString":"7 Years 8 Months","birthDate":"2012-11-17T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Shepherd \/ Labrador Retriever \/ Mixed (short coat)","breedPrimary":"Shepherd","breedPrimaryId":411,"breedSecondary":"Labrador Retriever","breedSecondaryId":162,"isBreedMixed":true,"coatLength":"Short","isCourtesyListing":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p>This is a happy dog that wants a home of her own.&nbsp; She may be a little shy but warms up once she knows you.&nbsp; She is good with other dogs.

Thankfully the witness happens to be a rescuer.&nbsp; \n\n\n\n\n\nPERSONALITY: Jacklyn is SUPER affectionate and sweet. She has lots of energy and loves attention.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAINING: Jacklyn will need leash training and at least a basic obedience course. She is already doing FANTASTIC with crate training and housebreaking. She is extremely smart.&nbsp; \n\n\n\n\n\nWOULD DO BEST:&nbsp; Jacklyn would do best in a home with a family that will spend lots of time loving her, playing with her, and training her. She requires a yard. Because she only has one eye, she is not a dog that can go off-leash hiking and must be kept on leash out in public at all times. \n\n\n\n\n\nCATS\/DOGS\/KIDS: Jacklyn is good with other big dogs that are not alpha. She is great with children that can handle her size\/energy. She is not recommended for homes with cats.&nbsp; \n\n\n\n\n\nVET RECORD:&nbsp;All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed\/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nAVAILABILITY:&nbsp;This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area.

He is looking for a home with humans that are very patient and understanding and realize that he will need adequate time to become familiar with them and his new home&hellip;.this will not happen in 1 week, or two weeks and likely not even 6 weeks. He is a wonderful doggie but wasn&rsquo;t allowed to have the best start in life and had no exposure to novel stimuli and very little interactions with humans until he was rescued by CBBCR at 5 months of age.He needs a forever home where he won&rsquo;t have to be crated for more than about 2-3 hours at a time&hellip;and a home that will give him plenty of opportunity to go outside for potty breaks&hellip;..or someone that would have access to a doggy daycare where he could go daily while his humans are at work away from home. (12\/6\/14)*******\n Ty is a very calm BC. One of the most, calm pups I&rsquo;ve ever been around. He is an observer and likes to lay and watch what is going on and takes it all in&hellip;. He enjoys lounging in the baby pool on hot days&hellip;.he LOVES squeaky toys but will shred them.&nbsp;He also like to have a good chew on a hard bone while he is sunning himself in the yard.&nbsp;He doesn&rsquo;t like to chase the water hose but loves to chase&nbsp;other dogs while he is chasing the water hose.&nbsp;He is an affectionate and cuddly guy. Good for bathing and nail trimming and acts reasonable on leash. Again, a softie and is worried when out of his familiar environment. He is the biggest of his brothers but is still in the 40# range. He is a sweetie pie but is soft and will also need a very patient and understanding human in his life. When meeting new people, he is typically stand-off-ish&hellip;..but is quiet. He does not bark at people he doesn&rsquo;t know and will warm up much more quickly than&nbsp;his brother. (9\/24\/14)*********************************  Ty is the biggest pup of the litter and is just as sweet as he is big! &nbsp;Born on September 16, 2013,&nbsp;he is one of the softest pups of the bunch and takes a little longer to warm up to new people and new environments than his brothers...but once he does is very much a joy to be around. He also loves squeaky toys and if left to his own with them, will&nbsp;shred them.... He loves playing with other doggies and is good with the kitties. He is VERY foodie and will be a fun boy to train due to his intense food drive! Again, I believe he will blossom into a wonderful companion level boy in the right home, that is patient and gentle and knows how to keep him feeling safe and satified in his new adventures!!(updated 3\/28\/14)","isDogsOk":true,"isNeedingFoster":false,"isFound":false,"priority":1,"isHousetrained":true,"indoorOutdoor":"Indoor Only","isKidsOk":false,"name":"Ty","pictureCount":22,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2529\/pictures\/animals\/6677\/6677765\/72039581_100x158.jpg","rescueId":"D140014","sex":"Male","sizeCurrent":45,"sizeGroup":"Medium","sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-ty-border-collie-dog","isSpecialNeeds":true,"specialNeedsDetails":"Ty needs to be placed in a home without children.","isSponsorable":false,"url":"https:\/\/comebyebcrescue.org\/animals\/detail?AnimalID=6677765","videoCount":1,"videoUrlCount":1,"createdDate":"2014-02-24T18:31:50Z","updatedDate":"2020-04-05T20:23:04Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"72039581"},{"type":"pictures","id":"72039632"},{"type":"pictures","id":"54698662"},{"type":"pictures","id":"59761095"},{"type":"pictures","id":"59761100"},{"type":"pictures","id":"41774167"},{"type":"pictures","id":"34907496"},{"type":"pictures","id":"32330920"},{"type":"pictures","id":"23599526"},{"type":"pictures","id":"24911314"},{"type":"pictures","id":"24911364"},{"type":"pictures","id":"24994371"},{"type":"pictures","id":"22879337"},{"type":"pictures","id":"20671203"},{"type":"pictures","id":"22879276"},{"type":"pictures","id":"22665127"},{"type":"pictures","id":"21208863"},{"type":"pictures","id":"20674679"},{"type":"pictures","id":"19516030"},{"type":"pictures","id":"19485026"},{"type":"pictures","id":"19516028"},{"type":"pictures","id":"27037932"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"2529"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"99"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"8"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"6684265","attributes":{"activityLevel":"Slightly Active","isAdoptionPending":false,"ageGroup":"Adult","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Domestic Short Hair (short coat)","breedPrimary":"Domestic Short Hair","breedPrimaryId":35,"isCatsOk":true,"coatLength":"Short","isCourtesyListing":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p>Like any true diva, Roxie can be incredibly sweet, but on her terms.

He is basically feral. In the time that he has been with me he has become very good at everything that he can predict and what becomes a routine in his day to day activities. <br \/><br \/>He knows how to get to the door to go outside, he goes to the proper gate to get in to his play yard area, he will come when called from his play yard to the door to come back inside, he will go find his crate and go in voluntarily. Just this past week or so he has been starting to want to approach me while other dogs are near me to get some good sniffs. I just ignore him and let him do his thing and I try not to put any social pressure on him whatsoever. <br \/><br \/>His interactions with other dogs has progressed much more rapidly. He loves meeting new dogs and regularly initiates play with other dogs. He really enjoys chew time with hard bones,&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">nylabones<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">, etc&hellip; and he will chase after balls then will act silly playing with the ball by himself. He was actually quite good for his bath and nail trim&hellip;..frozen as you can imagine&hellip;but didn&rsquo;t try to constantly flee like&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Livie<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;does. <br \/><br \/>When riding in the car he needs to be in a plastic crate&hellip;..in a wire crate he is frantic and tries to chew out of crate and screams like he is being killed&hellip;.in the plastic crate he is calm and quiet and rides very well. At the dog school he is learning to follow pressure from the leash on his collar&hellip;..but in a new environment such as the vet&hellip;where he can see the great outdoors&hellip;.he will frantically fight the leash and act completely feral&hellip;.. I carry him whenever we leave his familiar and safe little world.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>He will need a super secure, most likely a privacy fenced yard&hellip;.he does know how to dig in corners of fences and I have had to block all my corners, even with having the turf down. He should NEVER be left outside unattended&hellip;he is a major flight risk<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;and would be extremely difficult to catch<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">. <br \/><br \/>A new adopter would need to let him drag a line for several weeks until he could settle in to a new routine. The person that will best be suited for Gus and Livie for that matter&hellip;..is someone looking for a project&hellip;..to actually SAVE a dog. A person that has no expectations and is just patient and willing to let things progress at a slow speed. <br \/><br \/>He has tried but just&nbsp;struggles with himself about if it is safe to approach humans. I think another dog in the home is a good idea because he does really enjoy playing with other doggies and he is fine with cats.

He knows how to get to the door to go outside, he goes to the proper gate to get in to his play yard area, he will come when called from his play yard to the door to come back inside, he will go find his crate and go in voluntarily. Just this past week or so he has been starting to want to approach me while other dogs are near me to get some good sniffs. I just ignore him and let him do his thing and I try not to put any social pressure on him whatsoever. His interactions with other dogs has progressed much more rapidly. He loves meeting new dogs and regularly initiates play with other dogs. He really enjoys chew time with hard bones,&nbsp;nylabones, etc&hellip; and he will chase after balls then will act silly playing with the ball by himself. He was actually quite good for his bath and nail trim&hellip;..frozen as you can imagine&hellip;but didn&rsquo;t try to constantly flee like&nbsp;Livie&nbsp;does. When riding in the car he needs to be in a plastic crate&hellip;..in a wire crate he is frantic and tries to chew out of crate and screams like he is being killed&hellip;.in the plastic crate he is calm and quiet and rides very well. At the dog school he is learning to follow pressure from the leash on his collar&hellip;..but in a new environment such as the vet&hellip;where he can see the great outdoors&hellip;.he will frantically fight the leash and act completely feral&hellip;.. I carry him whenever we leave his familiar and safe little world.&nbsp;&nbsp;He will need a super secure, most likely a privacy fenced yard&hellip;.he does know how to dig in corners of fences and I have had to block all my corners, even with having the turf down. He should NEVER be left outside unattended&hellip;he is a major flight risk&nbsp;and would be extremely difficult to catch. A new adopter would need to let him drag a line for several weeks until he could settle in to a new routine. The person that will best be suited for Gus and Livie for that matter&hellip;..is someone looking for a project&hellip;..to actually SAVE a dog. A person that has no expectations and is just patient and willing to let things progress at a slow speed. He has tried but just&nbsp;struggles with himself about if it is safe to approach humans. I think another dog in the home is a good idea because he does really enjoy playing with other doggies and he is fine with cats. (9\/24\/14) Gus is being fostered at Stephany's in Plymouth, Indiana.

We're conveniently located about one hour east of Chicago, 2.5 hours north of Indianapolis, and only 45-minutes west of South Bend, Indiana.\n\nSince we were founded in 1977, our goal has been to find homes for homeless cats in our community. Once each cat is spayed or neutered, we focus on adopting the cat into a safe, loving and lasting home.\n\nAs a not-for-profit 501(c)(3), the Independent Cat Society is funded almost entirely through membership, adoption fees, fundraising events, and the generous tax-deductible donations of caring individuals, like you. Although we have a small cleaning and medicating staff, we operate our shelter mainly with volunteers. We do not receive any government funding.\n\nEvery cat admitted to our shelter is examined by a vet, is spayed or neutered, and is up-to-date on vaccines and necessary medical treatment. Our no-kill policy means we do not euthanize cats unless a veterinarian advises it to relieve suffering. \n\n \n\nOur Mission\n\nOur mission is to promote the welfare of all animals by working to:\n\nreduce pet overpopulation\neducate the public\nprevent cruelties to animals\npromote responsible pet ownership, and\npromote more humane legislation.","services":"TNR, adoptions, spay\/neuter

We rescue animals in need of new homes and loving families.  We make sure each of them is spayed or neutered and up-to-date on all routine vaccinations.  If other medical care or treatment is needed, we get that for them as well.  \n\nWe welcome them into our homes and our lives and really get to know their personalities and their needs.  Then we make it our mission to re-home them \u2026 and to place them in the forever home that will be perfect for them.  Some of them really need to have another pup companion while others will do fine being an \u2018only pet.\u2019  Some love having children to play with while others prefer being with adult people.  Some do well sharing a home with cats or other small pets while others, well \u2026 not so much.  And the only way you know this is by living with them!  \n\nWe also work to educate and encourage pet owners to spay or neuter their animals to a) help their pets lead longer, healthier lives and b) help reduce the numbers of homeless and unwanted animals in our Central Virginia communities.  It is such an easy thing to do!  Not only will it benefit your pet and your family, but it will help reduce the numbers of wonderful, adoptable animals that are euthanized every year.

FHPR is a private, not-for-profit organization that operates solely on private donations and volunteer efforts \n\nWe strive to be a valuable resource for individuals and groups with an interest in animal welfare and we continue to expand our efforts to reach out to the community on a variety of levels. Each weekend we hold adoption events at satellite facilities and animal-friendly businesses. We hope to maintain high public visibility through community events and other activities focused on topics such as spaying and neutering, volunteering and adoptions. \n","services":"Adoptions,

","about":"Diamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is an all volunteer group in the heart of Texas that is dedicated to the health, welfare and happiness of our dachshund friends. We are based in Kerrville, Texas but service all of San Antonio and the surrounding areas. Our volunteers come from San Antonio, Kerrville, and other parts of Central Texas. We are a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization. As such, we must rely heavily on donations and contributions, which are a necessity in order to continue to be able to pay the costs of health care, administrative needs, and other necessary expenses for each of our dachshunds. Diamond Dachshund has rescued, rehabilitated and placed approximately one hundred dachshunds each year since our incorporation in 1998. That's a lot of happy, healthy dogs and equally happy families! We strive to find the right home for each dog's individual personality and needs, so that the placement is permanent and both the dogs and the humans who adopt them, are equally

We rescue dogs at risk of being euthanized from shelters, abandoned, abused, and stray dogs. We also rescue many owner surrendered dogs; which are dogs that can no longer remain in their current homes due to financial or personal issues. I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue is dedicated to reducing the number of dogs that are euthanized in our shelters each and everyday.

Once we have reviewed\/approved your application, we will contact you to arrange a \"Meet & Greet\". Many of our dogs are in private volunteer foster homes. We must schedule a one-on-one \"Meet & Greet\" appointment with each individual dog. It takes time to schedule these appointments, however we do have a standard weekly adoption event at local Petco's, where we show dogs for adoption. We can arrange to have the foster's bring the dog to the Petco. This is the easiest way to set up a \"Meet & Greet\". These adoptions events are usually Saturday or Sunday.\n\nWhen going to a \"Meet & Greet\", please make sure you take any family members and other dogs to see how the initial introduction goes. That makes the entry into the new home easier for the dog and for you.\n\nHow it Works:\n\nIf your \"Meet & Greet\" goes well, you will complete an adoption contract at the appointment and can take the dog home then. We ask for a suggested adoption donation* to help us cover spay\/neutering, shots, medical treatment, food, and supplies. Then you and your new best friend live happily ever after. It's as simple as that! *Baja Dog Rescue is a 501c(3) non-profit and all donations go directly to the care of our dogs and are 100% tax deductible. The suggested adoption donations only partially cover the cost of the expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs.\n\nWhat if the adoption doesn't work out?\n\nWe have a lifetime return policy on our dogs as we don't want to see them turned back into a shelter. The application process helps prevent such an issue, so it's very important that you are honest when answering the questions. Not all dogs are compatible in all situations, so it is imperative that you are forthright in the application process to find the right match. However, be sure you are ready to make a full commitment to adopting a dog, whether a puppy or an adult. It can take a good 72 hrs for a dog to really adjust to his\/her new environment. A lot really depends on the dog's past so the prospect of adopting should be well-thought-out & the commitment should be taken seriously.","about":"Our Goal and Mission\n\nBaja Dog Rescue is a 501c(3) non-profit organization that is run by a group of dedicated volunteers. We rescue and rehabilitate unwanted, abandoned and neglected dogs and find them loving happy homes. We literally give them a second chance at life. And everybody deserves a second chance. We need your help to continue to save the lives of so many wonderful and loving dogs.\n\nGood-hearted humans can make all the difference! People who befriend, feed, foster, and bring these dogs back to good health are rescuers. Each one of our dogs is socialized, spay\/neutered, vaccinated, and treated for any medical or behavioral conditions. It's what you'll read about here - the work of rescuers who live in Baja California or in the San Diego, California area. We save street dogs and find them homes. You may never see such a deep devotion as these grateful dogs feel for a human who is simply kind to them. They radiate joy and it's contagious -- their adopters catch joy from them all the time.","services":"adoptions, rescue","type":"Rescue","lat":32.76639938354492,"lon":-117.12899780273438,"coordinates":"32.7664, -117.129","citystate":"San Diego, CA"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"89","attributes":{"name":"Basset Hound"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/89"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"8906591","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":36360,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":360,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/985\/pictures\/animals\/3419\/3419896\/8906591_500x360.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":36360,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":360,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/985\/pictures\/animals\/3419\/3419896\/8906591_500x360.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3085,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":72,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/985\/pictures\/animals\/3419\/3419896\/8906591_100x72.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2011-07-15T18:51:25Z","updated":"2011-07-15T18:51:25Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"985","attributes":{"name":"The Cat Shack, Inc.","street":"P.O.

The mission is to provide temporary housing to stray, unwanted and neglected cats and dogs until permanent loving homes can be found.  Our mission also includes controlling the pet overpopulation through low cost spay\/neuter programs.  We offer local low cost spay\/neuter programs for companion animals and low cost spay\/neuter programs for feral free roaming cats.

We appreciate your patience.\n    There is no need to complete a new application if you decide on a different animal - just send us an email.\n    Not every application will be approved.

From the Board of Directors to our Foster Caretakers to our Event Staff, each volunteer gives generously of their time and skills, motivated solely by a desire to help animals.\n\nA Second Chance Puppies and Kittens Rescue combines a no-nonsense goal of saving animals' lives with the blood, sweat, and tears of countless volunteers with financial support from various donors (individuals and corporations alike). Now in its sixth year, the group has rescued over 5,000 animals and continues to grow rapidly thanks in large part due to established relationships with various pet supply stores in Palm Beach County, including PetSmart and PETCO.\n\nAll of the grant writing, fundraising, application reviewing, event planning, supply collection, bathing and bottle feeding is done by volunteers who seek only to save the lives of pets. When opening their hearts just isn\u2019t enough for some, they open their doors - fostering dogs and cats in need until they are adopted. Their dedication has made the group one of the largest no-kill rescue groups without a shelter.\n\nRescuing and arranging adoptions into loving homes for so many animals and successfully treating dozens of heartworm positive dogs are monumental tasks that have not gone unnoticed by the local media. The Palm Beach Post, The Wellington Town Crier and The Observer have all written articles promoting the group and its goal of finding homes for homeless pets.\n\nAccomplishing our goal of saving homeless pets\u2019 lives by providing them with safe, healthy foster environments until they are adopted by loving forever families, requires funding to pay for the food and medical needs of the rescued animals. Donated funds go directly to covering food and supplies, veterinary expenses and medical supplies, and overhead costs (printing of forms, webpage hosting, etc.). A Second Chance Puppies and Kittens Rescue relies solely on donations. We do not receive any government funding or grants.\n\nWe hope that after all you\u2019ve learned about us, you will join us in our effort to save the homeless animals.

","about":"Organization was started by our Executive Director in 2009 after retiring from the gym business and realizing that Stafford County didn't have a no kill rescue facility. In our first year, we helped 15 animals. In 2010, we helped 108 animals and in 2011, we helped 191 animals.

You will be asked to sign a contract when adopting your pet.\n\nFMAR's suggested minimum donation for an adoption ranges from $80 for a cat or kitten, $150 for mixed breed adult dogs and $175 for puppies and full breed dogs. FMAR accepts cash, checks, money orders, Visa and MasterCard.  This donation helps defray some of the cost for vet expenses incurred for each animal, including but not limited to: spay\/neuter, de-worming, heartworm testing and treatment if necessary, FeLuk\/FIV testing, vaccinations, and other medications as required. We try to do whatever it takes to insure you are adopting the healthiest animal possible.  \n\nPlease be aware that the animals available for adoption are rescue animals and, as such, have often been exposed to a variety of diseases. Like human illnesses these disorders can have an incubation period up to several weeks. If the animal you adopt shows signs of illness within the first 3 days please contact the shelter right away. If the symptoms occur at any point after three days, please take it to your vet for treatment.\n\nPlease understand that we will not place a pet into a home if any of the following apply:\n\n    The prospective home currently has an un-spayed\/un-neutered pet.\n    The pet will be left outside unattended for long periods of time\n    The pet is intended as a gift.\n    Anyone in the household is afraid of the pet\n    Anyone in the household is aggressive to the pet \n\nOnce placed, FMAR reserves the right to:\n\n    Check on the pet at any time to ensure it's well-being\n    Remove the pet from the home if any conditions of the adoption contract have been violated or, if in the opinion of FMAR, the environment is unsafe.\n    IF at anytime you cannot keep your pet, you must return it to FMAR and not to any other individual or shelter.\n\n \n\nAdoption Procedures \n\n    Pet Selection \u0096 This is the first step in making an informed choice of what pet is right for you and your home environment. The following are items to consider.\n    Size of Pet \u0096 Is your home environment suitable for a large pet? If you live in a building with various pet controls, is there a limit to the size of the pet? If you rent, please bring a copy of your lease indicating that pets are allowed and what the limitations are.\n    Energy Level and Exercise Needs \u0096 Does your home and surrounding area have easy access to a safe exercise area? If you have a yard, is it adequately fenced? Is your fence tall enough for the type of dog which you have interest in (many dogs can scale a 4 foot fence)? If you don't have a fence do you have a plan for potty breaks? Do you have the time in your day to provide the needed exercise and companionship for this pet?\n    Compatibility \u0096 Do you have children or do children visit often? If so, does the pet you chose get along with children? Do you have other pets \u0096 does the pet you chose get along with the types of other animals in your home? If you are adopting a dog and you already have a dog (s) at home you will be required to bring him\/her with you when you visit. You will also be required to bring everyone else living in the home.\n\nAdoption Application\n\nFMAR's adoption application is used to match our adoptable pets with the best environments, lifestyles, and owner expectations. Please be honest when filling out the form and when talking to an FMAR adoption team member. All applications are reviewed by an FMAR team member for approval.\n\nIf you are going to attend an FMAR event it will help the process move faster if you can download the questionnaire, fill it out and bring it with you. If you would like to submit an application via email, you can scan it and forward it to shelter1@comcast.net. Questionnaires (applications) are available on our website at http:\/\/www.fmar1.org\/adoption_requirements0.aspx  Please do not mail applications to FMAR as the animal may already be adopted by the time it reaches us.\n\nAttend an Adoption Event to Meet an Animal\n\nYou are welcome to come to an adoption event to meet one of our adoptable animals. Please email the shelter at shelter1@comcast.net with the pets name, and the event you would like to meet him\/her at. Please send your request no later than three days prior to the event.\n\nAdoption Contract\n\nAfter the pet has been chosen and the adoption questionnaire approved, the adopting family will be given a packet and asked to sign a contract. Included in the packet will be the pet's medical records, pet tips and other informational hand outs, including a packet with instructions on how to activate your free month of health insurance. Please make sure you check your email as soon as you get home and follow the instructions if you do not receive the email. \n\nFMAR's goal is to make your adoption experience a pleasant one for both your family and the pet. We will do our best to fit the right pet with your family. If you have any questions during the process please feel free to ask. All questions are important to ensure the pet and family have the best possible start as well as continued success.    \n\n","about":"FMAR is a no-kill animal shelter. Our property includes two buildings. One for cats and one for dogs. The former includes a screened patio for the cats and the latter, a large yard for the dogs to play in. \n\nOnce we take in an animal, it has a home with us for it's lifetime. Some of the animals have stayed with FMAR for years before being adopted. \n\nThe animals at FMAR are rescued  from nearby pounds, accepted (as space is available) from the public, or left on our doorstep. FMAR is comprised solely of volunteers that have a deep love of animals. The shelters are thoroughly cleaned twice a day. All dogs are either walked or given play time in the yard every day. \n\nWe have an well developed TNR program, offer educational programs for kids, and allow people to volunteer to fulfill community service hours. \n\nFMAR is well-know and well-respected in our community, and we continue to strive to provide services to the people and animals in our area. \n","services":"Adoptions, TNR,

Our goal is to find the right family to love and care for the animals for their lifetime.\n \n     Releashed Rescue has a vision of a world where animals are not killed because they are inconvenient.  Instead, we hope to educate the public about pet over-population, spay , neuter, humane treatment of animals and how animals can enrich the lives of people including the elderly, children and those

We take in cats and kittens from the public but also make regular rescues from the local kill shelters. \n\nMission\n\nTo advocate for homeless cats in our community by:\n\u0095 Actively seeking permanent, loving homes for the cats in our care\n\u0095 Providing lifelong care to those cats who for behavioral or medical reasons are unable to be re-homed\n\u0095 Educating the public about responsible companion animal guardianship\n\u0095 Adhering to the principle of \u0093no-kill\u0094 in that no cat in our care will ever be euthanized to make room for another. Nor, will any cat in our care ever be destroyed except in cases of terminal and painful illness or when compassion demands it because there is no reasonable alternative.\n\nVision\n\nOur vision for the future is that:\n\n    Every cat is spayed\/neutered and is cared for in a loving home by a responsible guardian\n    People treat animals as the sentient beings they are, ensuring that they are neither exploited nor harmed\n    The Hermitage Cat Shelter is a world-class organization, providing sanctuary care for cats needing temporary or permanent shelter, and promoting the innate value of

you to visit the rescued animals, if you are approved. A home visit to check your living situation and environment for the animal may be required. We only do adoptions and visits on Saturdays and Sundays. You must bring with you 4 things; your valid drivers license, the adoption fee (as cash or check), a copy of your lease agreement (if applicable) and a vet approved animal carrier.\nLast but not least, our Adoption Contract must be read, filled out & signed!\n\nOur Adoption fees are: $85 per each Indoor cat or kitten & $50 per each Outdoor cat. Each cat or kitten will be up to date on all shots, vetting and depending on age, may be spayed\/neutered before being taken home. For two Indoor cats or kittens the adoption fee is a reduced cost of $155. For two Outdoor cats the adoption fee is a reduced cost of $90.\n\nA pet carrier is mandatory for transporting any animal, if you do not have one you may purchase a vet approved cat\/kitten carrier from us for $20.","about":"Here at ASHA we are doing what we can to help the animals. We are not yet a registered 501c3 rescue (but we are in the paper work process!) & we do not have a facility. We are just one family working with many friends, foster family's, volunteers, donors, supporters, neighbors & the community to try & make a difference in the world; One animal at a time. Our Board of Directors include: Our Founder & Executive Director Jessica Kratz, Pat Wilmsen is our Assistant Director, Matt Buleza  is our Treasurer & Catalina Ruiz is our Secretary. We also have the great honor and expertise of Robin Deltuva!\n\nWe help animals that are in dire and extreme situations such as: Running up and down high ways or living in sewer systems. We work in areas that are too dangerous for original TNR programs, such as beside highways, in the center of the city or in a building planed to be demolished. We go the extra mile that other people and groups wont. We have many years of experience with domestic, stray, feral, abused & abandoned pets. Also; small animals, farm animals and even experience wild animals and exotic animals. We are dedicated to bettering the lives of any animal that is unwanted or homeless. Through rescue, rehab, spay and neuter, and  adoption; we strive to lessen the number of animals that suffer from abuse and neglect. We treat every and any animal as family from the moment it comes in to our care and forever more. Any Animal once rescued by us is welcome back any time later in the future no matter what.\n\nASHA is NOT YET a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Animal Rescue Organization and does not receive funding from the county, state or federal government. We operate on the donations of our public (and private) supporters, donations and animal fees. All proceeds and donations go directly for the care and welfare of the animals. NO salaries are paid. Donations, fees or sales ARE tax deductible since we are in the process of becoming registered. Donate online today  via PayPalor send a check!\n\nI began helping the homeless animals in my little corner of the world in about 2000; Just an animal here, an animal there. Then as word began to spread, by 2002 my family and I had begun to made a name for our selves; \"the family that helps rescue animals.\" And as things happen, our weekend projects became our every day chores. We started rescuing more cats more frequently. Unfortunately there are more animals needing rescuing then there are families looking to adopt! Since we started in 2000 we have helped rescue and successfully re-homed over 650 animals!\n\nWe care about the animals because it is not their fault they are in the situation they are in, its never their fault. And because we are in a position where we can create a positive impact on their life we feel we must do all that we can. Stray and feral kittens and young cats that are caught and rescued are typically scared, aggressive and un-socialized at first. Thus; many places and people would deem them \"un-adoptable\" and would euthanize them on the spot, or send them back to the awful situation they came from.  We do not. We believe that with time, patience and love they are able to be rehabbed and eventually learn to trust humans. Some cats may take just days, others weeks or even months. Their options are limited if they do not shown that they can co-habitat with people; So we work hard to find the perfect forever family for each rescued animal. So we will do what we can, as often as we can to help the animals that are in need of us.\n\n                Animal Safe Haven and Adoptions, Inc. works to help rescue as many stray, feral, abandoned, homeless and abused animals from our community, the cities and the counties; as possible. We work to end the suffering of overpopulation and unwanted animals, to effectively reduce the number of animals abandoned and abused by supporting spay\/neuter programs. Provide temporary foster care for pets of people in a crisis who want their animals back. Catching, vetting & relocating feral colonies from dangerous areas in order to eventually end the suffering of all feral cats. We take in and adopt out cats, dogs, small animals and farm pets from all of Maryland. We provide food, shelter and vet care to the animals no matter what their age, breed or sex. With us they have no time limit to find the perfect forever family.","services":"We provide feral\/stray Have-a-Heart trapping, low cost boarding &

We then call references and prior vet(s), as well as run a background check for legal issues. The Board of Directors approves an applicant.  At that time, the animal is taken to the home and a home visit performed.  If it is satisfactory, the animal(s) is(are) left at the new home.  A two-week trial period ensues in order to make certain a \"perfect match\" has been made.  Either the adopter or PFM can remove the animal from the home during that two-week period. After that, the adoption is final.","about":"PFM has been formed by three people with over 30 years of rescue experience between them. We feel that there is a \"hole\" in current rescue\/shelter efforts and we hope to be able to help fill that hole. One aim is to help people understand their animals by education of animal behaviors.  Hopefully, that will reduce the number of animals being brought in to \"shelters\" in our area. We also intend to provide an online service where animals (who have been vetted by us) can be seen by potential adopters, whom we will vet the same way we do our own.  Additionally, there are animals we come into contact with who need immediate rescuing. We are a foster-based organization (limited), and will intake the animal(s) as soon as a foster home has room. We follow strict protocol for vaccinations (distemper and rabies), testing (FeLV\/FIV, heartworm, etc.), preventative (heartworm), spay\/neuter, and microchips. All of the animals available for adoption through our foster homes is up to date on all vaccinations and tests.  We spay\/neuter our animals between 4 and 6 months if young, and as soon as we intake them if older.  All of the members of PFM have previous fostering experience.  We do this because, as our mission states, \"Purr-Fect Match Animal Rescue is dedicated to the sanctity of all living things and their inherent right to a happy, healthy, and humane life.\"  We hope
