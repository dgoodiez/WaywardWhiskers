Tabitha is too interested in cats to live with any.\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

But that didn&#39;t stop Tiger&mdash;he bounced back and embraced people and life with all four paws. He is independent and would be good with older and not too demanding children. As he gets older he is not as sociable with other cats and he doesn&#39;t like dogs, but funny thing is, he acts like a dog. So, whether you like playing football or watching football, Tiger is your buddy, just fill out an application at www.friscohumanesociety.com or call <a href=\"tel:972-489-8980\">972-489-8980<\/a> to meet him.<\/p><img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?8951793\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","descriptionText":"Poor Tiger!

While we&#39;ve had her for adoption since and even at some of our events, Tina just doesn&#39;t &quot;show well&quot; which has led to her being with us for so long. But that doesn&#39;t mean that she isn&#39;t a simply wonderful girl and well deserving of her own home.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tina was brought to us as a puppy of only about 3 months of age. When her former owner&nbsp;asked if we could take her and her brother, Tuck, into our rescue, we had to ask him to bring them back in a couple of days so that we could prepared a kennel for them. Altho the man agreed, he simply left our rescue and then abandoned both pups into the yard of a lady, who witnessed his actions, and drove away. The following day, the woman brought both pups to us and told us what this man had done.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tina has grown into a very loving and devoted dog to those she knows. She will bark defensively at strangers but after she gets to know someone, she is very affectionate towards them. You have to realize that Tina&#39;s &quot;home&quot; has been our rescue and she acts with us as she would if she&#39;d been in a home for these past few years.

He is a loving boy and often will come sit with us with his head in our laps.&nbsp; He is very loyal to his humans but prefers to be the only dog in the home.&nbsp;He is fully vetted - vaccinated, neutered, Rabies, microchipped, and is current on heartworm preventative. &nbsp;His adoption fee is $150.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more about Fred, you can email us at: &nbsp;newbeginnings_animalrescue@yahoo.com. &nbsp;If you would like to apply to adopt Fred, please click on this link to our online application: &nbsp;https:\/\/form.jotform.com\/NBAR\/PetAdoptionApplication \n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for considering adopting a rescued pet!\n\n","isDogsOk":true,"earType":"Erect","energyLevel":"Moderate","exerciseNeeds":"Moderate","fenceNeeds":"6 foot","isNeedingFoster":false,"isFound":false,"groomingNeeds":"Low","priority":10,"isHousetrained":true,"indoorOutdoor":"Indoor and Outdoor","isKidsOk":true,"killReason":"0","name":"Fred","newPeopleReaction":"Friendly","obedienceTraining":"Has Basic Training","ownerExperience":"Species","pictureCount":2,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5806\/pictures\/animals\/9519\/9519671\/31760642_100x130.jpg","qualities":["cratetrained","intelligent","noFemaleDogs","noLargeDogs","noMaleDogs","noSmallDogs","olderKidsOnly","playful","playsToys"],"rescueId":"Pol-D-Fred","searchString":"Fred  Black mask Brindle with White Male Medium Pol-D-Fred Black mask Dogs Boxer \/ Corgi \/ Mixed (short coat)s","sex":"Male","sheddingLevel":"Moderate","sizeCurrent":42,"sizeGroup":"Medium","sizePotential":40,"sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-fred-boxer-dog","isSpecialNeeds":false,"isSponsorable":false,"url":"https:\/\/newbeginningsanimalrescue.rescuegroups.org\/animals\/detail?AnimalID=9519671","videoCount":1,"videoUrlCount":1,"vocalLevel":"Some","isYardRequired":true,"createdDate":"2015-12-30T20:46:21Z","updatedDate":"2021-07-03T15:29:19Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"31760642"},{"type":"pictures","id":"31760659"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"5806"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"104"},{"type":"breeds","id":"126"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"8"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"9525910","attributes":{"activityLevel":"Moderately Active","isAdoptionPending":false,"adultSexesOk":"All","ageGroup":"Adult","ageString":"10 Years 7 Months","availableDate":"2021-08-12T00:00:00Z","birthDate":"2010-12-21T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"American Staffordshire Terrier \/ English Bulldog \/ Mixed (short coat)","breedPrimary":"American Staffordshire Terrier","breedPrimaryId":82,"breedSecondary":"English Bulldog","breedSecondaryId":350,"isBreedMixed":true,"isCatsOk":true,"coatLength":"Short","isCourtesyListing":false,"isCurrentVaccinations":true,"isDeclawed":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p>I AM IN FOSTER CARE!

I would be fine with one or two older ones (around 10+). My anxiety got really high before I was returned and I&#39;m currently on generic Prozac and am doing fabulous! I&#39;m settling into my foster home just great and have a foster sister I love playing with. I would either prefer a no dog or one dog home (the dog MUST be little if there&#39;s one already in the home, around 20 lbs). I do love puppies, so if you wanted to adopt me and later on adopt a puppy, I would be fine with that, too! I am housetrained, neutered, vaccinated, and heartworm negative. I&#39;m also not a typical Lab mix, in that my foster mom has seen no destructive tendencies and hasn&#39;t seen me chew on any furniture and I would NOT be suitable for a dog park situation.

I would be fine with one or two older ones (around 10+). My anxiety got really high before I was returned and I&#39;m currently on generic Prozac and am doing fabulous! I&#39;m settling into my foster home just great and have a foster sister I love playing with. I would either prefer a no dog or one dog home (the dog MUST be little if there&#39;s one already in the home, around 20 lbs). I do love puppies, so if you wanted to adopt me and later on adopt a puppy, I would be fine with that, too! I am housetrained, neutered, vaccinated, and heartworm negative. I&#39;m also not a typical Lab mix, in that my foster mom has seen no destructive tendencies and hasn&#39;t seen me chew on any furniture and I would NOT be suitable for a dog park situation. I am a typical Lab mix, though in that I LOVE people, car rides, sleeping on the bed, and eating treats.\n\nIf you&#39;d like more info, email your number to rockcityrescue@gmail.com!&nbsp;","isDogsOk":true,"energyLevel":"Moderate","exerciseNeeds":"Moderate","isFound":false,"priority":10,"isHousetrained":true,"indoorOutdoor":"Indoor Only","isKidsOk":true,"name":"Sampson","newPeopleReaction":"Friendly","obedienceTraining":"Has Basic Training","ownerExperience":"None","pictureCount":4,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5724\/pictures\/animals\/9772\/9772390\/59652949_100x150.jpg","qualities":["affectionate","doesWellInCar","goofy","intelligent","noHeat","playful","playsToys"],"sex":"Male","sizeGroup":"Large","sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-sampson-chesapeake-bay-retriever-dog","isSponsorable":false,"videoCount":0,"videoUrlCount":0,"createdDate":"2016-03-15T17:46:13Z","updatedDate":"2020-09-29T00:13:40Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"59652949"},{"type":"pictures","id":"59652950"},{"type":"pictures","id":"59652951"},{"type":"pictures","id":"59652952"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"5724"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"117"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"8"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"9788868","attributes":{"activityLevel":"Moderately Active","isAdoptionPending":false,"adultSexesOk":"All","ageGroup":"Adult","ageString":"4 Years 9 Months","birthDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Labrador Retriever \/ Mixed (short coat)","breedPrimary":"Labrador Retriever","breedPrimaryId":162,"isBreedMixed":true,"coatLength":"Short","isCourtesyListing":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(38, 40, 42); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><b>Mouth open in greeting, dark brindle beauty, Rhea, is cavorting about with one of her many friends.

She&rsquo;s rat terrier and chihuahua and somehow she&rsquo;s extra of each! Anything and everything below that may seem challenging are classic breed characteristics but since Hazel is a little extra, previous rat terrier and\/ or chihuahua experience is required to set everyone up for success.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">She loves walks! Other than treats, walks are Hazel&rsquo;s favorite thing!<\/li>\n\t<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">Hazel walks very nicely on leash. She either walks next to you or in front of you, but doesn&rsquo;t pull at the leash.<\/li>\n\t<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">Hazel loves to snuggle with you. (When she feels like it! I mean, she is a rattie, so she&#39;s super independent) Her preferred sleeping spot is under the covers with you! She&rsquo;s also a perfect date to Netflix &amp; chill with.<\/li>\n\t<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">Hazel is very food motivated - this makes training so much easier!<\/li>\n\t<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">Hazel is a great guard dog! She takes her duty to protect the house and her family very seriously. Strangers beware!<\/li>\n\t<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">Hazel loves toys and will play by herself or with a friend! Hazel loves other dogs, but only the dogs in her family. She currently lives with large and small dogs. &nbsp;She would love a live-in dog buddy to play with but does not tolerate canine visitors who are seen as a threat that she must protect her family from. Needless to say, occasional play dates and dog parks are out of the question. She is also fine as an only dog.<\/li>\n\t<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">She doesn&rsquo;t need a crate! In fact, Hazel has some history with crating and while I&rsquo;m a staunch supporter of crate training, it will not work for this dog. Fortunately, that&rsquo;s no problem because she isn&rsquo;t destructive when left out!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; min-height: 20.3px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">Some things to be aware of about Hazel<\/p>\n\n<ol style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\t<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">Hazel is an anxious, fearful little girl. She&rsquo;s on fluoxetine (doggie Prozac) which is helping a ton, but she&rsquo;s never going to be a happy-go-lucky kind of gal. She was not well socialized. She is especially afraid of men and kids. Hazel is not a family dog. She would do best with a single person or couple in a quiet household with infrequent visitors. She needs time. and patience. and love. When she knows she&rsquo;s done well, she gets SO proud of herself and prances and wags her WHOLE body. It will make your entire day.<\/li>\n\t<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">It takes Hazel a long time to give you her trust. This is a product of her fear and her anxious temperament. Gaining her trust will be an evolution over months, not days or weeks. In the meantime, she needs a safe place to go when needed and someone who will patiently and persistently pursue her love and trust. I&rsquo;ve found that mostly she wants to feel safe and protected. If you have the patience and are willing to put in the time, winning the trust of a fearful dog will melt. your. heart. Guaranteed.<\/li>\n\t<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">Hazel is fully housetrained. But. She is a nervous peer and no signal if she needs to go, so you have to pay attention or take her out on a schedule. Her previous owner left pads out as a just-in-case and Hazel was using them. When it rains, Hazel has held it a surprisingly long time. She also poops in the house. It is what it is.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;\">Hazel is a great guard dog! This is characteristic of her breeds and she takes it very seriously, whether you actually feel threatened or not. She needs a confident handler, experienced with either chihuahuas or rat terriers. Hazel would not fit in a busy household with people\/dogs coming and going.

She&rsquo;s rat terrier and chihuahua and somehow she&rsquo;s extra of each! Anything and everything below that may seem challenging are classic breed characteristics but since Hazel is a little extra, previous rat terrier and\/ or chihuahua experience is required to set everyone up for success.&nbsp;\n\tShe loves walks! Other than treats, walks are Hazel&rsquo;s favorite thing!\n\tHazel walks very nicely on leash. She either walks next to you or in front of you, but doesn&rsquo;t pull at the leash.\n\tHazel loves to snuggle with you. (When she feels like it! I mean, she is a rattie, so she&#39;s super independent) Her preferred sleeping spot is under the covers with you! She&rsquo;s also a perfect date to Netflix &amp; chill with.\n\tHazel is very food motivated - this makes training so much easier!\n\tHazel is a great guard dog! She takes her duty to protect the house and her family very seriously. Strangers beware!\n\tHazel loves toys and will play by herself or with a friend! Hazel loves other dogs, but only the dogs in her family. She currently lives with large and small dogs. &nbsp;She would love a live-in dog buddy to play with but does not tolerate canine visitors who are seen as a threat that she must protect her family from. Needless to say, occasional play dates and dog parks are out of the question. She is also fine as an only dog.\n\tShe doesn&rsquo;t need a crate! In fact, Hazel has some history with crating and while I&rsquo;m a staunch supporter of crate training, it will not work for this dog. Fortunately, that&rsquo;s no problem because she isn&rsquo;t destructive when left out!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome things to be aware of about Hazel\n\n\n\tHazel is an anxious, fearful little girl. She&rsquo;s on fluoxetine (doggie Prozac) which is helping a ton, but she&rsquo;s never going to be a happy-go-lucky kind of gal. She was not well socialized. She is especially afraid of men and kids. Hazel is not a family dog. She would do best with a single person or couple in a quiet household with infrequent visitors. She needs time. and patience. and love. When she knows she&rsquo;s done well, she gets SO proud of herself and prances and wags her WHOLE body. It will make your entire day.\n\tIt takes Hazel a long time to give you her trust. This is a product of her fear and her anxious temperament. Gaining her trust will be an evolution over months, not days or weeks. In the meantime, she needs a safe place to go when needed and someone who will patiently and persistently pursue her love and trust. I&rsquo;ve found that mostly she wants to feel safe and protected. If you have the patience and are willing to put in the time, winning the trust of a fearful dog will melt. your. heart. Guaranteed.\n\tHazel is fully housetrained. But. She is a nervous peer and no signal if she needs to go, so you have to pay attention or take her out on a schedule. Her previous owner left pads out as a just-in-case and Hazel was using them. When it rains, Hazel has held it a surprisingly long time. She also poops in the house. It is what it is.&nbsp;\n\tHazel is a great guard dog! This is characteristic of her breeds and she takes it very seriously, whether you actually feel threatened or not. She needs a confident handler, experienced with either chihuahuas or rat terriers. Hazel would not fit in a busy household with people\/dogs coming and going. Obviously, we all have visitors occasionally and I can help you with how to manage her during these visits.\n\tShe hates being left alone and will bark continuously until someone returns. For this reason Hazel cannot live in an apartment or any home with shared walls. Only exception would be retired or working from home post- COVID. Another dog counts as company!\n\n\nSo, admittedly, Hazel is a bit of a challenge at first. But I promise she&rsquo;s SO worth it. And she deserves a someone who will love and cherish her for every plus and every minus and love her forever.\n\nIdeal would be a person or couple who is home a lot, doesn&rsquo;t have tons of visitors, may have another dog, and would love to invest in a best friend.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThrough the course of my veterinary care at Secondhand Hounds it was discovered that I have a systolic click, which can be an early indicator of cardiac disease.

Once rehabilitated and ready, they are carefully matched with prospective adopters and placed in loving homes. Over 23,000 pets have been adopted from Animal House Shelter.\n\nLike people, animals have distinct personalities that make them unique. At Animal House Shelter, we are proud to say that the dogs and cats are treated like our own. We care enough to be certain they are treated with the comfort and respect that they deserve and we make every effort to ensure that they go to the right, forever, permanent, loving home.\n\nThe best possible veterinary care is always given to Animal House Shelter pets and treatment is never declined if it will give the animal a chance for a healthy life. Socializing and keeping our pets happy is also of utmost importance. Dogs are walked 4-5 times daily and cats are housed in a large, whimsical, free-roam habitat All are given loving care and attention by staff and volunteers.\n\n All dogs and cats are given all vaccinations- including their Rabies vaccine if old enough. They are neutered,  microchipped,  dewormed and heartworm tested (Dogs)  or FeLV\/FIV tested (Cats). Dogs are kept on heartworm preventative & all animals receive Frontline Plus monthly by Animal House.\n\nAnimal House takes in many special needs animals.  We take care of any ailment or surgery that needs to be done on any animal we rescue including, but not limited to: heart worm treatments, cruciate ligament repair, patella surgery, FHO, heart surgery, diabetes, anxiety disorders, auto immune deficiencies, liver shunts etc.  On average, AHS takes in at least one animal per week that has one of the above ailments or needs surgery.  We do not believe that any animal should be left to be euthanized at a high kill facility because they are sick or injured.  Society has already failed them at one point in time and someone needs to speak up and rescue those that are defenseless and without a voice.  That is who we are are and that is what Animal House Shelter has always been about.  These ailments & surgeries are extremely expensive and we need the communities help to not leave these poor souls to be discarded with no one to care for them.","services":"adoptions","type":"Shelter","lat":42.175899505615234,"lon":-88.44879913330078,"coordinates":"42.1759, -88.4488","citystate":"Huntley, IL"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"127","attributes":{"name":"Dachshund"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/127"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"155","attributes":{"name":"Italian Greyhound"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/155"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"23791670","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":1096949,"resolutionX":2274,"resolutionY":2755,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/23791670_2274x2755.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":35825,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":605,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/23791670_500x605.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3241,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":121,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/23791670_100x121.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2014-11-20T20:02:49Z","updated":"2014-11-20T20:03:50Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"22340701","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":1831464,"resolutionX":2448,"resolutionY":3264,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/22340701_2448x3264.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":47220,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/22340701_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4117,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/22340701_100x133.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2014-08-29T23:34:05Z","updated":"2014-11-20T20:03:50Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"23791674","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":1085635,"resolutionX":2274,"resolutionY":2755,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/23791674_2274x2755.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":34904,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":605,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/23791674_500x605.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3219,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":121,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/23791674_100x121.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2014-11-20T20:03:32Z","updated":"2014-11-20T20:04:00Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"21080117","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":1430838,"resolutionX":1888,"resolutionY":1802,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/21080117_1888x1802.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":49924,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":477,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/21080117_500x477.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3703,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":95,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/21080117_100x95.jpg"},"order":4,"created":"2014-06-14T22:39:32Z","updated":"2014-11-20T20:04:00Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"21080118","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":939835,"resolutionX":2119,"resolutionY":1347,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/21080118_2119x1347.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":25335,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":317,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/21080118_500x317.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2690,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":63,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/21080118_100x63.jpg"},"order":5,"created":"2014-06-14T22:39:33Z","updated":"2014-11-20T20:03:56Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"22340706","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":2169954,"resolutionX":2448,"resolutionY":3264,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/22340706_2448x3264.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":41298,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/22340706_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3832,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/124\/pictures\/animals\/7101\/7101989\/22340706_100x133.jpg"},"order":6,"created":"2014-08-29T23:36:03Z","updated":"2014-11-20T20:03:54Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"124","attributes":{"name":"Paws Animal Rescue, Inc.","street":"P.O.

PROCESS\nAdoption Applicant Requirements Include:\n\u0084X\tMust be 18 years of age or older\n\u0084X\tMust provide a valid driver\u00a1\u00a6s license or identification\n\u0084X\tMust reside in the home where the animal will be placed\n\u0084X\tApplication must be filled out by the adopter; no one is allowed to complete the application on behalf of a potential adopter. \n\u0084X\tIf the applicant rents a home, Landlord information will be required including a statement from the Landlord agreeing to allow pets.\nWhen the adopter has selected the pet they wish to adopt, they will fill out an Adoption Questionnaire.  The questionnaire will provide information about their past experience with pets, the type of pet they are looking for and also their expectations of the new pet. The purpose of the questionnaire is not to exclude them from adopting. It is simply a tool that helps the Center match people with a pet that would best fit their lifestyle and expectations.\nBefore an adoption can be approved, the following is required:  \n\u0084X\tApplicant has spent time to get acquainted with the animal they are interested in\n\u0084X\tApplicant has been interviewed by a Paws and Claws volunteer\n\u0084X\tAll family members and\/or roommates must meet the animal\n\u0084X\tIf there are other animals in the home, an introduction will be needed to assure the animals compatibility  and  documentation that the other animals are current on vaccinations and spayed  or neutered\n\u0084X\tA home check may or not be required; each adoption will vary due to the needs of the particular animal.  If a home check is required, a convenient time for all parties will be set.\n\nFINALIZING THE ADOPTION\n\u0084X\tReview the contract with the adopter.  Discuss each item in the contract and ask the adopter to initial each one.\n\u0084X\tReview Paws and Claws return policy.\n\u0084X\tReview the animal\u00a1\u00a6s medical information.\n\u0084X\tScan the animal to assure that the microchip information is correct.\n\u0084X\tObtain the Adoption Donation.\n\u0084X\tExplain Paws and Claws follow-up procedure.\n\u0084X\tHave the adopter sign and date the adoption agreement.  The Paws and Claws volunteer coordinating the adoption must sign as well.\n\u0084X\tGive the adopter a copy of the adoption agreement and the animal\u00a1\u00a6s medical records.\n\nFOLLOW-UP PROCEDURE\nAdopters do not always call the Center when they experience a problem; therefore, it is important to follow-up after the adoption to assure problems are addressed in a timely manner.  Good follow-up helps lower the return rate and maintains a successful adoption relationship.\nAdoption follow-up contacts via telephone or e-mail will be done:\n\u0084X\tThree days after the adoption,\n\u0084X\tThree weeks after the adoption, and\n\u0084X\tThree months after the adoption.\nSome important questions to ask include:\n\u0084X\tHow is the animal settling into the new routine and home?\n\u0084X\tAre there any behavioral issues that we can assist with?\n\u0084X\tHas the animals name been changed?\n\u0084X\tHow are the other pets in the home adjusting to the newest member of the family?\nAll information received from the adopter will be recorded in the animal\u00a1\u00a6s file.\n\nRETURN POLICY\nNo matter how careful the Center will be in attempting to match the right pet with the right family, there will be occasions where animals are returned to the Center.  Adoption Donations are not refundable\nAdoption Donation of $80 for dogs, $50 for cats, $100 for puppies, and $75 for kitties is requested.

We are not yet a registered 501c3 rescue (but we are in the paper work process!) & we do not have a facility. We are just one family working with many friends, foster family's, volunteers, donors, supporters, neighbors & the community to try & make a difference in the world; One animal at a time. Our Board of Directors include: Our Founder & Executive Director Jessica Kratz, Pat Wilmsen is our Assistant Director, Matt Buleza  is our Treasurer & Catalina Ruiz is our Secretary. We also have the great honor and expertise of Robin Deltuva!\n\nWe help animals that are in dire and extreme situations such as: Running up and down high ways or living in sewer systems. We work in areas that are too dangerous for original TNR programs, such as beside highways, in the center of the city or in a building planed to be demolished. We go the extra mile that other people and groups wont. We have many years of experience with domestic, stray, feral, abused & abandoned pets. Also; small animals, farm animals and even experience wild animals and exotic animals. We are dedicated to bettering the lives of any animal that is unwanted or homeless. Through rescue, rehab, spay and neuter, and  adoption; we strive to lessen the number of animals that suffer from abuse and neglect. We treat every and any animal as family from the moment it comes in to our care and forever more. Any Animal once rescued by us is welcome back any time later in the future no matter what.\n\nASHA is NOT YET a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Animal Rescue Organization and does not receive funding from the county, state or federal government. We operate on the donations of our public (and private) supporters, donations and animal fees. All proceeds and donations go directly for the care and welfare of the animals. NO salaries are paid. Donations, fees or sales ARE tax deductible since we are in the process of becoming registered. Donate online today  via PayPalor send a check!\n\nI began helping the homeless animals in my little corner of the world in about 2000; Just an animal here, an animal there. Then as word began to spread, by 2002 my family and I had begun to made a name for our selves; \"the family that helps rescue animals.\" And as things happen, our weekend projects became our every day chores. We started rescuing more cats more frequently. Unfortunately there are more animals needing rescuing then there are families looking to adopt! Since we started in 2000 we have helped rescue and successfully re-homed over 650 animals!\n\nWe care about the animals because it is not their fault they are in the situation they are in, its never their fault. And because we are in a position where we can create a positive impact on their life we feel we must do all that we can. Stray and feral kittens and young cats that are caught and rescued are typically scared, aggressive and un-socialized at first. Thus; many places and people would deem them \"un-adoptable\" and would euthanize them on the spot, or send them back to the awful situation they came from.  We do not. We believe that with time, patience and love they are able to be rehabbed and eventually learn to trust humans. Some cats may take just days, others weeks or even months. Their options are limited if they do not shown that they can co-habitat with people; So we work hard to find the perfect forever family for each rescued animal. So we will do what we can, as often as we can to help the animals that are in need of us.\n\n                Animal Safe Haven and Adoptions, Inc. works to help rescue as many stray, feral, abandoned, homeless and abused animals from our community, the cities and the counties; as possible. We work to end the suffering of overpopulation and unwanted animals, to effectively reduce the number of animals abandoned and abused by supporting spay\/neuter programs. Provide temporary foster care for pets of people in a crisis who want their animals back. Catching, vetting & relocating feral colonies from dangerous areas in order to eventually end the suffering of all feral cats. We take in and adopt out cats, dogs, small animals and farm pets from all of Maryland. We provide food, shelter and vet care to the animals no matter what their age, breed or sex. With us they have no time limit to find the perfect forever family.","services":"We provide feral\/stray Have-a-Heart trapping, low cost boarding & adoptions!","type":"Rescue","lat":39.207801818847656,"lon":-76.82640075683594,"coordinates":"39.2078, -76.8264","citystate":"Columbia, md"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"28660239","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":243487,"resolutionX":1200,"resolutionY":800,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660239_1200x800.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":20905,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":333,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660239_500x333.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2453,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":66,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660239_100x66.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2015-09-06T13:52:50Z","updated":"2015-09-06T13:52:53Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"28660240","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":280049,"resolutionX":800,"resolutionY":1200,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660240_800x1200.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":42678,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":750,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660240_500x750.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3759,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":150,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660240_100x150.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2015-09-06T13:52:50Z","updated":"2015-09-06T13:52:53Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"28660241","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":293993,"resolutionX":1200,"resolutionY":800,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660241_1200x800.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":28360,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":333,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660241_500x333.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2642,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":66,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660241_100x66.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2015-09-06T13:52:51Z","updated":"2015-09-06T13:52:53Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"28660242","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":374667,"resolutionX":1205,"resolutionY":1800,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660242_1205x1800.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":31345,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":746,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660242_500x746.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3467,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":149,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5166\/pictures\/animals\/7203\/7203199\/28660242_100x149.jpg"},"order":4,"created":"2015-09-06T13:52:51Z","updated":"2015-09-06T13:52:53Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"5166","attributes":{"name":"Friends of the Seal Beach Animal Care Center","street":"1700 Adolfo Lopez Drive","city":"Seal Beach","state":"Ca","postalcode":"90740","country":"United States","phone":"(562) 430-4993","email":"contact@sbacc.org","url":"http:\/\/www.sbacc.org","facebookUrl":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Seal-Beach-Animal-Care-Center-SBACC\/107417815974883","adoptionProcess":"We have an application process and an adoption contract.

You can also stop by the SMAS during business hours to view all of our adoptable pets and spend some one-on-one time with them. \n\n \n\nAfter you've decided which pet you are interested in adopting, the next step is to complete an adoption application. All adopters must complete an application and be approved for adoption before taking their new friend home. Completion of an adoption application does not guarantee that you will be able to adopt the specific pet you applied for, nor are you obligated to adopt by completing an adoption application. In the event that an animal has multiple adoption applications submitted, the decision on which applicant will be able to adopt the animal will be left to the staff based on the best interest of the animal.  \n\n \n\nWe typically have the application processed within 24 hours of submission. Applicants can expect a phone call regarding the status of their application the day after they submit it. If you have not received a phone call within a 2 or more days, please call us.","about":"The Stephen Memorial Animal Shelter (SMAS) is a small animal shelter located in Oskaloosa, Iowa. Built in 1991, the original facility's sole purpose was to serve as a \"pound\" for stray animals in Mahaska County. As with most animal impound facilities, animals that were not adopted or claimed after 7 days were euthanized. Since then, the SMAS has evolved beyond the old \"pound\" ideology.\n\n\u200b\n\nOUR MISSION: The mission of the Stephen Memorial Animal Shelter is to serve as a community resource for pets and people, dedicated to enhancing the welfare of all companion animals\n\n \n\nIn 2011, the SMAS stopped euthanizing animals for space and started looking for alternatives to euthanasia. Through partnerships with other shelters and breed rescues, as well as programs aimed at increasing the adoption rate of the animals in their care, the SMAS went from a dismal live release rate of 40% (meaning 40% of the animals taken in leave the shelter alive) to a live release rate of 93%. In may of 2014, we celebrated our first month of a 100% live release rate, a milestone we are very proud of. \n\n \n\nThe SMAS is NOT a no-kill shelter, yet we are still able to maintain a euthanasia rate of less than 8%.\n\n \n\nIn addition to taking in and re-homing stray, abandoned, abused, and otherwise homeless animals, the SMAS, in partnership with the Mahaska Humane Society, has developed programs aimed to educate the community and promoting responsible pet ownership. Some of these programs include visits to the elementary school to teach dog bite prevention, bringing dogs to the local university during finals week as stress relief for students, visiting nursing

potential adopters must fill out an application and go through an interview. Our adoption facilitators walk them through the shelter and help them find the perfect animal that would best match their homes. After a potential adopter signs up for a specific animal, there is a cool-down period. \n\nWe do veterinarian reference checks and follow-up telephone calls on Mondays to make sure the potential adopters are still interested. After the telephone interview has taken place, a home visit is set up and the selected animal is delivered to it's new home. \n\nOur adoption fees are $85 for one cat or kitten and $130 for two cats or kittens. The adoption fee includes various procedures which have already been performed, such as:\n\nFeline Leukemia and Feline Immunodeficiency virus tests\nDistemper shots\nRabies Booster\nPreventative Dewormer\nSpay or neuter for all cats at least 8 months of age or older \nAn adoption folder complete with an \"Animal Health Log Sheet\" containing the cat's health history.\n\nKittens must be adopted in pairs if there are no other CATS in the home. Other animals (dogs, birds etc.), people and\/or kids do not count.\n\nUnder no circumstances do our animals leave the shelter the same day they are signed up for.","about":"Happy Endings is a 501(c)3 non-profit, no kill organization that has been in existence since 1994. It is run solely by volunteers. Our mission is to find permanent homes for strays, abused or unwanted animals that are either brought in to us or rescued off the street. \n\nHappy Endings provides a safe haven for all cats, including; feral, stray, abused, neglected and or critically injured animals. We nurse those who are sick back to health and provide a home for all animals until they are ready to be adopted. No animal is ever euthanized by Happy Endings for convenience sake, but, only when, in a veterinarian's professional opinion is in a state of terminal suffering.","services":"Adoptions","type":"Shelter","lat":42.959598541259766,"lon":-87.9928970336914,"coordinates":"42.9596, -87.9929","citystate":"Milwaukee,

Email or call us about which animal you are considering and we can make an appointment for you and the animal to meet. Visit the Adoption Information page at www.mshoogys.org to fill out our adoption application and email it to one of our volunteers. You can also print a copy, fill it out, and bring it with you to M'Shoogy's during our hours of operation, which are Saturdays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. Please note that if you are applying to adopt a dog, we usually require that you have a fenced-in yard except in special situations.\n\nThe cost to adopt is just $59 which includes shots and the cost of spaying\/neutering. If you are adopting a dog we also ask that you purchase 6 months of heartworm preventative. It is sold by weight. If you check around, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find it is the lowest cost adoption service in the area.","about":"With a strict no-kill policy, several hundred dogs, cats and other animals of all ages and sizes call M'Shoogy's home. It costs approximately $50.00 per month per animal, excluding  medicine, and approximately $500.00 per day to open the door.  In over 19 years, we have saved more than 15,000 animals from certain death.\n\nGary and Lisa Silverglat started M'Shoogy's and have given and lived a 24 hour commitment to the animals. They have had four days away from the Sanctuary in 19 years. They have never taken a salary for themselves, only given everything they have with no thought of monetary compensation.  There are also other individuals, volunteers, and employees who help provide care and love for the animals.\n\nSeveral acres in the back are also dedicated to wildlife rehabilitation. Many animals are given medical attention and food until they are old enough and\/or well enough to be reintroduced into the wild. Summer and spring brings around a large amount of raccoons and possums. Fox, owls, deer, squirrels and ducks have all called M'Shoogy's home for a little while.\n\n\nM'Shoogy's also provides educational tours and talks for groups to teach the importance of treating animals with dignity and respect. Permit laws and legislation against animal abuse have also been passed with M'Shoogy's

Potential applicant searches our available dogs and\/or cats listings and completes an adoption application.\n\n2.

The foster volunteer coordinates a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeet and greet\u00e2\u0080\u009d with you and any other members of your household.\n\n4. If the foster and adopter agree the pet is a good fit, a home visit will be scheduled. Upon completion of a successful home visit, you will complete and sign our adoption contract, pay the fee, and take home your new pet!","about":"Underdog Rescue and Placement was founded in 2000 by Shannon McKenzie. Having volunteered for several other animal rescue organizations, Shannon saw a need to help the dogs and cats often overlooked by other rescuers, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnderdogs\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur very first rescues included a pair of black kittens named Fenway & Wrigley, a pitbull puppy named Lucy and a tiny Toy Poodle named Lily (who was suffering from a head injury). No other rescue groups would take Fenway or Wrigley because black kittens are often overlooked by potential adopters, and, up until the time we rescued Lucy, rescue groups had not been allowed to rescue any dog considered to be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cPit Bull\u00e2\u0080\u009d from Minneapolis Animal Control.\n\nWhile in law school, Shannon McKenzie had the \u00e2\u0080\u009canti-pitbull\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy changed, with the assistance of Attorney, Marshall Tannick. Underdog Rescue continues to successfully rescue and place pitbulls and other \u00e2\u0080\u009cbully-breeds\u00e2\u0080\u009d through a continued partnership with Minneapolis Animal Control.\n\nShannon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dedication to the Underdog also extends to puppy mill survivors. Dogs that survive life in a puppy mill often come with a different set of challenges. They may require additional medical care, socialization and teaching of basic dog skills even though some may be adults. Our volunteers understand this and welcome these pets into their homes to show them what life as a dog and life with kind humans is like.\n\n","services":"Adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":44.94889831542969,"lon":-93.33519744873047,"coordinates":"44.9489, -93.3352","citystate":"St. Louis Park,

The mission is to provide temporary housing to stray, unwanted and neglected cats and dogs until permanent loving homes can be found.  Our mission also includes controlling the pet overpopulation through low cost spay\/neuter programs.  We offer local low cost spay\/neuter programs for companion animals and low cost spay\/neuter programs for feral free roaming cats.  We actively participate in humane education programs with a group of volunteers from surrounding counties to elementary and high schools those counties.  BCHS was formed because we saw a need for improving animal welfare in Bond County.","services":"adoptions, spay\/neuter, humane

","about":"Diamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is an all volunteer group in the heart of Texas that is dedicated to the health, welfare and happiness of our dachshund friends. We are based in Kerrville, Texas but service all of San Antonio and the surrounding areas. Our volunteers come from San Antonio, Kerrville, and other parts of Central Texas. We are a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization. As such, we must rely heavily on donations and contributions, which are a necessity in order to continue to be able to pay the costs of health care, administrative needs, and other necessary expenses for each of our dachshunds. Diamond Dachshund has rescued, rehabilitated and placed approximately one hundred dachshunds each year since our incorporation in 1998. That's a lot of happy, healthy dogs and equally happy families!

with you to identify your interests and needs in regards to a companion animal that would be suitable for your home. Our Adoption Questionnaire (PDF) for Dogs or Cats covers most of the issues which we have found relevant to helping you find your new companion and smooth the transition for both of you.\n2.\tAfter reading your questionnaire, one of our volunteers may make suggestions as to which animals may be best suited to you and your lifestyle and make an arrangement for you to meet them at our Weekend Adoptions or in their foster homes to get to know each other.\n3.\tIf you fall in love on the spot, please make sure you have read the \"Before You Adopt\" section because this is a big, and important decision, not just for the human involved, but also for the companion animal. We can then proceed with the next stop of the adoption process which is commonly called the \"Home Safety-Check\"\n4.\tAn Adoption Fee is required along with a signed adoption agreement, which ensures that if, for any reason, you are unable to keep the animal, he\/she is to be returned to Forte Animal Rescue only.\n5.\tFinally, we personally deliver your new family member to your home.","about":"Our Mission:\n\nTo inspire compassion and responsibility for animals, in addition to rescuing, rehabilitating and finding homes for companion animals.\n\nOur Profile:\n\nForte Animal Rescue is an all-volunteer 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, seeking solutions for pet-overpopulation, as well as working together with the community to cultivate the human-animal bond through educational programs and activities.\n\nOur Objectives:\n\n\tAfter years of work in animal rescue, we established this unique organization in January 2003 to function as a \"hub\" for people and the rescue community in order to help each other. We believe this is necessary in helping the rescue community to achieve its common goals of saving the lives of as many animals as possible.\n\n\tStop people from taking their animals to the pound through our Outreach Program by advising them of possible solutions, introducing them to appropriate trainers for their specific problems, or assisting them in finding new homes for their pets through our Adoption Program.\n\n\tServe as a liaison between animals and the general public. Our new educational program will help improve pet-people relations and understanding of responsibilities. This is especially important because lack of such knowledge is one of the direct causes of abandonment of companion animals.","services":"Adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":33.977901458740234,"lon":-118.44499969482422,"coordinates":"33.9779, -118.445","citystate":"Marina del Rey, CA"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"32131251","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":269001,"resolutionX":1020,"resolutionY":943,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/32131251_1020x943.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":31177,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":462,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/32131251_500x462.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3224,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":92,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/32131251_100x92.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2016-01-19T14:59:28Z","updated":"2021-03-20T00:04:58Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"76411369","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":479629,"resolutionX":960,"resolutionY":1280,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/76411369_960x1280.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":91105,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/76411369_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":5548,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/76411369_100x133.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2021-01-15T21:19:16Z","updated":"2021-03-20T00:04:58Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"63949088","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":7610211,"resolutionX":2448,"resolutionY":3264,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/63949088_2448x3264.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":90825,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/63949088_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":5090,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/63949088_100x133.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2019-01-29T15:12:48Z","updated":"2021-03-20T00:04:58Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"78628539","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":594559,"resolutionX":1200,"resolutionY":1600,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/78628539_1200x1600.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":69158,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/78628539_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4486,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/8435\/8435448\/78628539_100x133.jpg"},"order":4,"created":"2021-05-13T00:35:10Z","updated":"2021-05-13T00:35:10Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"4442","attributes":{"name":"Castoff Pet Rescue","city":"Blairsville","state":"GA","postalcode":"30512","country":"United States","phone":"(706) 487-4539","email":"info@castoffpetrescue.org","url":"http:\/\/castoffpetrescue.org\/","facebookUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CastoffPetRescue\/","adoptionProcess":"Adoption fees vary for cats and dogs.

We were founded in 1984 and later formed as a committee under The Basset Hound Club of Greater Fort Worth. In 1997, NTBHR was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in the State of Texas. In June of 1998, NTBHR was classified as a 501(c)3 Charitable Organization by the IRS, meaning your gifts to us are tax-deductible.  Our Tax ID # is 75-2706935\n\nNorth Texas Basset Hound Rescue is organized for the following purposes:\n\nPrevent cruelty to animals, specifically basset hounds;\nSupport animal welfare by locating and retrieving homeless, unwanted and\/or mistreated basset hounds;\nProvide necessary funding for medical care, spaying and neutering, for unwanted and\/or mistreated basset hounds; and\nPlace homeless, unwanted, and or mistreated canine basset hounds in permanent, loving homes.\n \n\nThe general area of rescue is the Fort Worth and Dallas area, but we also cover many shelters in North Texas from Abilene to Waco, Longview to the Oklahoma border.  Money is spent to insure that the bassets are healthy, neutered or spayed, and treatment for heartworms. On occasion we must make the tough decision of euthanasia due to health problems or aggressive behavior. Rescue volunteers receive no compensation for their countless hours and transportation costs. NTBHR is very fortunate to have several veterinarians who provide excellent treatment at a reduced rate.  The rewards of a rescue volunteer come from knowing that a basset is getting a second chance and from a slobbery lick and a wagging tail.\n\nNorth Texas Basset Hound Rescue (NTBHR), an all-volunteer organization, rescued and re-homed 85 Basset Hounds in fiscal year 2012-13.  All animals are given medical care including spay\/neuter, heartworm treatment, dental care and micro-chipping.  Providing information on spay\/neuter programs, micro-chipping,  and participating in responsible pet ownership events  lets us achieve our goals of rescuing Basset Hounds and serving the community.  NTBHR has developed a Special Needs Fund, which is used to rehabilitate Basset Hounds that would not have otherwise been adoptable due to illness, mistreatment or injury.   Our goals for the current year are to increase our volunteer base, our foster care program, allowing us to rescue more Basset Hounds and to increase our fundraising to cover our increasing veterinary costs.","services":"Vaccinations, spay\/neuter, heartworm treatment, microchiping, adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":32.934200286865234,"lon":-97.07749938964844,"coordinates":"32.9342,

Stewart's 3rd Infantry Division shipped out to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2006, the organization moved to Glenwood, Georgia. Southern Comfort fills a critical need in Wheeler County, which has no other rescues or animal control.\n\nWe specialize in physical, social and emotional rehabilitation of our rescues. All animals are examined, vaccinated, spayed or neutered and receive any and all medical treatment before being placed in carefully screened forever homes.\n\nSouthern Comfort is a \"no-kill\" rescue and only euthanizes in cases of irremediable suffering or vicious and dangerous animals.\n\nWe also work to raise public awareness of the plight of homeless animals and promote the benefits of adopting an animal in need through community outreach and education.","services":"adoptions, rescue, ","type":"Rescue","lat":32.157901763916016,"lon":-82.68280029296875,"coordinates":"32.1579,

","about":"Rescue Ridge is a highly recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit, no-kill animal rescue organization in Monmouth County, that has been steadily saving lives for over ten years.  Formed by the efforts of a local woman in 2001, Terri Willis committed her life to helping the animals of our community.  Born with a severe heart defect, Terri never allowed her disability to slow her down.  Her endless love, determination and dedication to all the animals was heartwarming and remarkable.  When she passed away, the animal community lost a great advocate and rescuer.  Although no longer with us, Terri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undying spirit continues on through her dream\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. The dream of Rescue Ridge.\n\nStaffed entirely by volunteers, Rescue Ridge relies exclusively on donations, sponsorships and fundraisers for support, which goes back to the animals.  With the help of our many followers and volunteers, we primarily serve the Monmouth and Ocean Counties of the Jersey Shore, but have gone much further to rescue animals in need.  Known in our area as the \u00e2\u0080\u009clast chance\u00e2\u0080\u009d rescue, we have taken in many animals slated for euthanasia by shelters.  Animals come to us from all over the communities we serve for many different reasons.  We have helped animals whose owners could no longer care for them due to age, illness, behavioral or economic reasons, keeping them out of the overcrowded shelters and adopting them back into loving homes.  We have never turned away a stray or any animal in distress.  We have taken in \u00e2\u0080\u009cdifficult\u00e2\u0080\u009d dogs that most other rescues or shelters would not even consider.  We take the time to socialize them, work with them and ultimately make them adoptable.\n\nOur vision is to take our efforts to a new level.  Committed to saving the lives of our community pets, Rescue Ridge is dedicated to the goal of introducing a no-kill shelter to Monmouth County.  Beyond a shelter, this safe haven for animals will offer our community the help it needs to finally put an end to the senseless deaths and unnecessary loss of life that these animals face daily.  Our focus will include education and affordable medical care to pet owners, keeping their animals healthy, comfortable and in their homes where they belong.  Never should a family have to surrender their pet to a shelter because they cannot afford their medical treatment.  We will also extend microchipping to our fellow animal lovers, making sure lost pets find their way home and not behind the bars of a shelter, where they can quickly wear out their welcome waiting for their family to find them.  We would be a proactive leader in putting an end to animal overpopulation by offering a true low cost spay\/neuter clinic.  A TNR (Trap & Release) Program would also be offered for feral cats, which would help keep the cat overpopulation to a minimum.  Our adoption center would be a safe and happy place, where families can come meet their new best friend.  Beyond all of this, we will offer affordable training and animal socialization to our communities, which will in turn, reinforce public safety and ensure the safety of our beloved pets.  This safe haven will be run by staff and our dedicated, experienced volunteers, many of whom have been with us for over ten years.\nBeing tremendous animal lovers, we all share the same belief that we can and we will make a difference, one animal at a time.  We know that this is not an easy task ahead, but there are many people and groups that will whole-heartedly support our efforts in making this happen.  And we are proud to have their encouragement.  \n\n","services":"adoptions, fostering","type":"Rescue","lat":40.15359878540039,"lon":-74.03829956054688,"coordinates":"40.1536,

We're conveniently located about one hour east of Chicago, 2.5 hours north of Indianapolis, and only 45-minutes west of South Bend, Indiana.\n\nSince we were founded in 1977, our goal has been to find homes for homeless cats in our community. Once each cat is spayed or neutered, we focus on adopting the cat into a safe, loving and lasting home.\n\nAs a not-for-profit 501(c)(3), the Independent Cat Society is funded almost entirely through membership, adoption fees, fundraising events, and the generous tax-deductible donations of caring individuals, like you. Although we have a small cleaning and medicating staff, we operate our shelter mainly with volunteers. We do not receive any government funding.\n\nEvery cat admitted to our shelter is examined by a vet, is spayed or neutered, and is up-to-date on vaccines and necessary medical treatment. Our no-kill policy means we do not euthanize cats unless a veterinarian advises it to relieve suffering. \n\n \n\nOur Mission\n\nOur mission is to promote the welfare of all animals by working to:\n\nreduce pet overpopulation\neducate the public\nprevent cruelties to animals\npromote responsible pet ownership, and\npromote more humane legislation.","services":"TNR, adoptions, spay\/neuter

Dogs Rock is a not for profit animal rescue founded in 2015. We exist solely on donations and will rely primarily on fundraising to help animals in need.\n\nOur mission is to raise awareness of the ever growing plight of homeless animals in this country, both in shelters and those dumped on our streets. Way too many amazing animals are euthanized every single day simply because they are homeless.\n\nWe want to introduce these animals to the public and educate people that unwanted companion animals are not damaged goods or unworthy, but really can be great family pets. Because the abuse, neglect, cruelty and medical cases cost shelters the most money and are the most urgent, they are often the first animals euthanized.\n\nIt is our goal to focus on the rescue of these urgent animals and provide them immediately the routine, emergency or specialized medical care they need and deserve. We will go beyond just vet care and get these animals rehabilitated as needed using trainers and behaviorists to help overcome issues related to past trauma.\n\nIt is our belief that no injured or abused animal should lose its life simply due to lack of funds. We do not have our own shelter, and we will rely on volunteers, fosters and adopters to take the animals into their homes and provide them with proper care and nurturing.\n\nAll of our animals will be vaccinated, heartworm tested, micro-chipped and altered. All of our homes, foster or adopter, will be fully screened, including references and vet check, an interview with the applicant and a home visit to ensure the home is the right fit for the animal.\n\nOur outreach and education efforts will take place online via Facebook, web site and other social media as well as in person in the community via community events, school assemblies and any

overpopulation, particularly pit bulls, through spay\/neuter intervention. Educating the public about responsible pet ownership through adoption as opposed to purchase.\n\nPibbles & More Animal Rescue was started with the belief that no animal should die unwanted. After seeing the abundance of Pit bulls in shelters we decided to try to do something about it.\n\nIn the beginning it was a small crew who banded together to form Pibbles & More Animal Rescue. We pull and re-home dogs from death row in the NY ACC shelters as well as from the Northeastern states where we have fosters, and from NC, SC and Georgia gassing shelters. \n\nWe all have the hope that one day we will be a no kill nation. Until then, we rescue as many dogs as we can, get them medical treatment and put them into foster homes until permanent homes can be found. We take in healthy dogs, mange dogs ,heart-worm positive dogs and dogs who have been abused or have broken bones and open wounds. When we are done, only the scars remain, and the beautiful animals underneath shine through. \n\nThe potential is there, for dogs to get a second chance at life, to know what love feels like. This is what we strive for every day. \n\nTo find responsible loving owners for the bullies of the world.","services":"adoptions, foster,

Camp Papillon is to place our companion animals in lifetime, loving homes. Every home and every companion animal has it 's own unique personality and requirements. We place our animals in the supportive and loving environment of home foster care. While there, we gain knowledge about their personality, training skills, likes and dislikes.\n\nTo assist us with matching the correct companion animal with the most appropriate and compatible home,please email us the answers to the below questions and any other information you think would be helpful. The emailed information may be followed-up by a Camp Papillon Adoption Coordinator, with a phone interview and then a home check.\n\nAdoption contract and post adoption follow-up checks are required as a condition of adoption. Some companion animals get multiple applicants or are not appropriate matches, so not all adoptions will be approved. Not all applicants will receive a yes or no response due to limited staff. We reserve the right to refuse any adoption without justification. \n\n\nOur Adoption Costs\nDogs: $250\nPuppies:$300\nPuppies $50 Refund after proof of spay\/neuter\nCats: $75\nKittens: $100\nKittens $25 Refund after proof of spay \/ neuter\nRabbits, Ferrets, etc: $25\n\nWhy the high cost? Can't I adopt an animal for less? No.. and here's why: Our animals come fully vetted. It costs us less for medical care then you due to non-profit discount. So if you adopt an animal for less it will cost you more later. Spay & Neutering your animals, along with keeping up on shots prevents disease & illnesses.\n","about":"Camp Papillon is a non-profit, no-kill 501c3 animal rescue group dedicated to giving all homeless animals a place to call home. All of our animals are currently housed in foster homes, we don't have an actual location for housing the animals we rescue. These foster families are made up of dedicated volunteers who open their homes to dogs, cats, rabbits and other animals that are in need of a place to live until they can be adopted.\n\nThis allows the fosters to evaluate the animals and determine how they interact with people, other dogs, cats, etc. so we can place them in their forever homes. In some cases, the animals are ready for adoption upon entering our rescue. Others need some training or have behavioral issues that need to be addressed before we put them up for adoption. Many shelters would have euthanized dogs that they deem unadoptable, but not us. The foster situation is the best way to be sure these animals are well socialized with people and, most times, with other animals.

for animals.  Located in Huddleston, VA, we are truly in the heart of Virginia \u2013 30 minutes from Lynchburg, 30 minutes from Smith Mountain Lake, 30 minutes from Bedford, and 60 minutes from Roanoke.\n\nOur motto is \u201cRescue \u2026 rehome \u2026 real love\u201d and we try to live it every day.  We rescue animals in need of new homes and loving families.  We make sure each of them is spayed or neutered and up-to-date on all routine vaccinations.  If other medical care or treatment is needed, we get that for them as well.  \n\nWe welcome them into our homes and our lives and really get to know their personalities and their needs.  Then we make it our mission to re-home them \u2026 and to place them in the forever home that will be perfect for them.  Some of them really need to have another pup companion while others will do fine being an \u2018only pet.\u2019  Some love having children to play with while others prefer being with adult people.  Some do well sharing a home with cats or other small pets while others, well \u2026 not so much.  And the only way you know this is by living with them!  \n\nWe also work to educate and encourage pet owners to spay or neuter their animals to a) help their pets lead longer, healthier lives and b) help reduce the numbers of homeless and unwanted animals in our Central Virginia communities.  It is such an easy thing to do!  Not only will it benefit your pet and your family, but it will help reduce the numbers of wonderful, adoptable animals that are euthanized every year.

Thankfully now, we've been working with our local animal control and they are finally not destroying all animals deemed feral. Unfortunately, there are still too many breeding animals (feral and domestic) that need help so we can stop the needless, mass reproduction. Sometimes that's a well-meaning individual who feeds cats and after a couple of years, realizes there is a problem, or it could be an elderly person who can't afford to vet their animals. The animals not only need our advocacy but occasionally the people we help do as well. We adopt the animals that can be adopted and find special placement for others that aren't so readily \"adoptable\".
