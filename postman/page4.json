Annabelle would be a great running buddy and will keep you laughing for hours on end if you adopt this unpredictable bundle of crazy joy!\n\nAnnabelle will do best in a home with older kids, as&nbsp;she is a&nbsp;larger dog and could have a tendency to knock little ones down accidentally.&nbsp; If you would like to meet ANNABELLE, please visit our website for our application&nbsp;www.underdogaz.com&nbsp;or email us for more info at info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you would like to meet Annabelle, please visit our website for our adoption application, www.underdogaz.com or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\n&nbsp;","isDogsOk":false,"energyLevel":"High","exerciseNeeds":"High","fenceNeeds":"6 foot","isNeedingFoster":false,"isFound":false,"priority":10,"isHousetrained":true,"indoorOutdoor":"Indoor Only","isKidsOk":true,"name":"ANNABELLE \"Annie\"","newPeopleReaction":"Friendly","obedienceTraining":"Needs Training","ownerExperience":"Species","pictureCount":17,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5371\/pictures\/animals\/11446\/11446379\/49626825_100x149.jpg","rescueId":"D170100","sex":"Female","sizeGroup":"Large","sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-annabelle-annie-boxer-dog","isSpecialNeeds":false,"isSponsorable":true,"url":"https:\/\/underdogaz.rescuegroups.org\/animals\/detail?AnimalID=11446379","videoCount":0,"videoUrlCount":2,"vocalLevel":"Some","isYardRequired":true,"createdDate":"2017-05-26T03:01:49Z","updatedDate":"2018-06-12T06:14:06Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"49626825"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49626461"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49626406"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49626531"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49626414"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49626381"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49626423"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49626485"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49626592"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49626719"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49627339"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49169480"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49169477"},{"type":"pictures","id":"49169481"},{"type":"pictures","id":"45449825"},{"type":"pictures","id":"45449826"},{"type":"pictures","id":"45449827"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"5371"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"104"},{"type":"breeds","id":"179"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"8"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"11446398","attributes":{"activityLevel":"Slightly Active","isAdoptionPending":false,"adultSexesOk":"Women Only","ageGroup":"Adult","ageString":"3 Years 10 Months","birthDate":"2017-04-15T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Domestic Short Hair \/ Siamese \/ Mixed (short coat)","breedPrimary":"Domestic Short Hair","breedPrimaryId":35,"breedSecondary":"Siamese","breedSecondaryId":59,"isBreedMixed":true,"isCatsOk":true,"coatLength":"Short","isCourtesyListing":false,"isDeclawed":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p>Donny is very sweet but gets very verbal and loud when telling you that he wants your attention, but he doesn&rsquo;t want to be snuggled.

Coco is spayed, microchipped and fully vaccinated.&nbsp; She is also potty trained, leash and crate trained.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s ready to have a family of her own&nbsp;and will make an amazing companion.","isDogsOk":true,"earType":"Natural\/Uncropped","energyLevel":"Low","exerciseNeeds":"Low","eyeColor":"Brown","fenceNeeds":"6 foot","isNeedingFoster":false,"isFound":false,"groomingNeeds":"Not Required","priority":10,"isHousetrained":true,"indoorOutdoor":"Indoor and Outdoor","isKidsOk":false,"killReason":"0","name":"Coco","newPeopleReaction":"Friendly","obedienceTraining":"Has Basic Training","ownerExperience":"None","pictureCount":25,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5497\/pictures\/animals\/11618\/11618347\/64989663_100x149.jpg","qualities":["affectionate","cratetrained","eagerToPlease","doesWellInCar","intelligent","lap","leashtrained","noSmallDogs","obedient","olderKidsOnly","playful","playsToys"],"sex":"Female","sheddingLevel":"Moderate","sizeCurrent":62,"sizeGroup":"Large","sizePotential":65,"sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-coco-labrador-retriever-dog","isSponsorable":false,"tailType":"Long","videoCount":0,"videoUrlCount":0,"vocalLevel":"Some","isYardRequired":true,"createdDate":"2017-07-02T23:51:15Z","updatedDate":"2019-04-30T19:09:57Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"64989663"},{"type":"pictures","id":"64989654"},{"type":"pictures","id":"64989659"},{"type":"pictures","id":"64989618"},{"type":"pictures","id":"64989488"},{"type":"pictures","id":"64989541"},{"type":"pictures","id":"64989593"},{"type":"pictures","id":"64989664"},{"type":"pictures","id":"64989666"},{"type":"pictures","id":"57193672"},{"type":"pictures","id":"57212951"},{"type":"pictures","id":"57212957"},{"type":"pictures","id":"50843510"},{"type":"pictures","id":"55661260"},{"type":"pictures","id":"58811520"},{"type":"pictures","id":"57193675"},{"type":"pictures","id":"57193674"},{"type":"pictures","id":"57193663"},{"type":"pictures","id":"54773253"},{"type":"pictures","id":"55661258"},{"type":"pictures","id":"55493667"},{"type":"pictures","id":"54842945"},{"type":"pictures","id":"48174740"},{"type":"pictures","id":"50843512"},{"type":"pictures","id":"48174773"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"5497"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"162"},{"type":"breeds","id":"179"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"8"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"11623253","attributes":{"activityLevel":"Moderately Active","adoptionFeeString":"75","isAdoptionPending":false,"adultSexesOk":"All","ageGroup":"Adult","ageString":"4 Years 5 Months","birthDate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Domestic Short Hair \/ Tabby \/ Mixed (short coat)","breedPrimary":"Domestic Short Hair","breedPrimaryId":35,"breedSecondary":"Tabby","breedSecondaryId":63,"isBreedMixed":true,"isCatsOk":true,"coatLength":"Short","isCourtesyListing":false,"isDeclawed":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.5in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(33, 33, 33); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\">\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif, serif, EmojiFont;\">\n<span class=\"x_SpellE\">This is sweet Ginger.

She is very mellow overall but can get crotchety with young dogs who are disrespectful.&nbsp;She knows her basic commands and walks well on leash with a training collar. Snowflake loves playing in the yard, car rides and running errands with her person. She is a perfect companion dog who is non-intrusive when you are busy.

my name is Sebastian and here are some things you need to know about me:All dogs are special ... some of God's finest creations, and then there are those who need very special heroes to help them live their best lives. Can you be Sebastian's hero?Sweet Sebastian &hellip; what a little mystery he is.&nbsp; Per the previous owner, his mom is a Boston Terrier and dad is a Chihuahua &hellip; which explains the gorgeous brindle coat, the underbite, the big ears and the goofy personality.&nbsp; He is such a puzzle because once he trusts you, you see a different pup, but until he decides to let you into his world, he is afraid of everything and he tries to hide. He is very cautious of human touch and does not want anyone to pick him up.&nbsp; He will jump into your lap when he is ready, but he still does not want even his best human friend to pick him up.&nbsp; And if pushed too quickly, he will warn with a low growl.&nbsp; He seems to be partial to women, although he does fine with his foster dad.&nbsp; We are trying to untangle all the pieces of his puzzle to make his world a happier place.\nSebastian needs a special home with a patient family!&nbsp; He will do best with a family with doggy experience &hellip; not a good choice for a first pet.&nbsp; This little boy is truly a diamond-in-the-ruff.&nbsp; A big investment of time and patience in him will be sure to reap great rewards.If you do not feel like you can adopt and meet his special needs, you can still help him by&nbsp;sponsoring his extended care with tax-deductible donations.&nbsp; A one-time donation, or monthly or&nbsp;quarterly donations designated for Sebastian's care will be appreciated.\nApproximate age\/birthdate:&nbsp; born July 22, 2014  Weight\/size: ~14 lbs  Housebroken:&nbsp; YES (if you do your part and take him out regularly)  Crate trained:&nbsp; YES  Personality: &nbsp;very cautious, timid, slow to warm up, but sweet and loving once he does, a bit cautious of human touch until he knows he can trust\nEnergy level:&nbsp; medium&nbsp; Fenced yard&nbsp;required?:&nbsp;&nbsp; YES &ndash; due to the fact that he is very skittish, he tends to be in &lsquo;flight&rsquo; mode so he&nbsp;must have&nbsp;a physical fence for his own safety &hellip; no exceptions\nDoes he\/she jump fences?&nbsp; NO\nLeash walk:&nbsp; YES (be cautious and use a secure harness and a sturdy leash)&nbsp; Obedience training:&nbsp; NO  Riding in vehicles:&nbsp; RIDES OK &hellip; gets a little stressed at first but settles quickly  Spayed\/neutered:&nbsp;&nbsp; YES  Up-to-date on routine vaccinations:&nbsp;&nbsp; YES  Microchipped:&nbsp;&nbsp; YES  Social with other dogs:&nbsp; YES   Social with cats: &nbsp;Has not been around cats\nGood with children: &nbsp;He might eventually be OK with older, calm children but any excessive noise and activity makes him really nervous and he wants to hide.\nAdoption donation: &nbsp;$175\nIf you think&nbsp;Sebastian might be the perfect pup for you, please go to www.allamericanmuttrescue.org\/forms and complete your adoption application online. \nWe are an all-volunteer group, so please be patient and understand that it takes an average of 7-14 days to process the applications including reference checks, follow-up questions and home visits.&nbsp; You can expedite the process by providing accurate email addresses for all your references.&nbsp; Time to make phone calls is limited and we often have multiple applications in process.&nbsp; We&nbsp;make every effort&nbsp;to move through them as quickly as possible.\nWhen your application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if Sebastian picks you too. \nIf it seems that the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee, and an adoption contract to be signed.

Such a unique dog must have an equally unique story and Bentley is no exception! Bentley&rsquo;s story starts with him landing in a municipal shelter where this active and friendly dog had no outlet for his energy. He was then transferred to our partner organization, Save Our Strays, that saw the potential and drive in Bentley and started working towards getting him into a board and train facility that would benefit him. That&rsquo;s where Adopt-A-Dog and Ernesto at DOGS 360 came in; to train and work with Bentley until we could find him a home. This program had Bentley working with both Ernesto and other dogs daily to help work on his manners and also provide much-needed socialization. The greatest boon is that this program was in a home environment, so Bentley got a foster experience while also becoming the dog we knew he could be.<\/span>\n<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Nexa Regular&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Nexa Regular&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Nexa Regular&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Due to his stay at DOGS 360, Bentley has made great strides in his socialization skills as well as his manners. We learned that Bentley is a tug master who has plenty of canine friends. He is the ideal companion for a family that likes to be outdoors (he LOVES going for bike runs) and would be by your side on a hike. Bentley&rsquo;s ideal future family would learn all the training he has learned and continue to give Bentley the structure and consistency he needs to flourish. For that reason, we would love to see Bentley in a home with older kids that could learn his training alongside him.

Such a unique dog must have an equally unique story and Bentley is no exception! Bentley&rsquo;s story starts with him landing in a municipal shelter where this active and friendly dog had no outlet for his energy. He was then transferred to our partner organization, Save Our Strays, that saw the potential and drive in Bentley and started working towards getting him into a board and train facility that would benefit him. That&rsquo;s where Adopt-A-Dog and Ernesto at DOGS 360 came in; to train and work with Bentley until we could find him a home. This program had Bentley working with both Ernesto and other dogs daily to help work on his manners and also provide much-needed socialization. The greatest boon is that this program was in a home environment, so Bentley got a foster experience while also becoming the dog we knew he could be.\n\n\nDue to his stay at DOGS 360, Bentley has made great strides in his socialization skills as well as his manners. We learned that Bentley is a tug master who has plenty of canine friends. He is the ideal companion for a family that likes to be outdoors (he LOVES going for bike runs) and would be by your side on a hike. Bentley&rsquo;s ideal future family would learn all the training he has learned and continue to give Bentley the structure and consistency he needs to flourish. For that reason, we would love to see Bentley in a home with older kids that could learn his training alongside him. He is a friendly and goofy dog that is waiting to become your next family member, so why not come and meet him today?

Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on&nbsp;approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done.

As a volunteer based group, we all&nbsp;have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on&nbsp;approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\n\n\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay\/neutered,&nbsp;on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com.

He truly is a big teddy bear learning how to love life and embrace all that is around.\n\n\n\nDo you have time, love, patience and an open heart to share with Loki?

If you would like to be the lucky one who gets to give Cloud her happy ever after, please fill out an adoption application here:&nbsp;http:\/\/www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org\/general-application&nbsp;\n\n\nRDR&#39;s adoption fees include the cost of spay\/neuter\/microchip at an RDR-approved facility, whether completed before adoption or if deferred because&nbsp;the pet is too young or has a medical issue.&nbsp; All pets are also current on age-appropriate vaccines at the time of adoption\n\n\n\nGiven technical constraints on this database, this pet&#39;s location may not be as listed here.

Dogs Rock is a not for profit animal rescue founded in 2015. We exist solely on donations and will rely primarily on fundraising to help animals in need.\n\nOur mission is to raise awareness of the ever growing plight of homeless animals in this country, both in shelters and those dumped on our streets. Way too many amazing animals are euthanized every single day simply because they are homeless.\n\nWe want to introduce these animals to the public and educate people that unwanted companion animals are not damaged goods or unworthy, but really can be great family pets. Because the abuse, neglect, cruelty and medical cases cost shelters the most money and are the most urgent, they are often the first animals euthanized.\n\nIt is our goal to focus on the rescue of these urgent animals and provide them immediately the routine, emergency or specialized medical care they need and deserve. We will go beyond just vet care and get these animals rehabilitated as needed using trainers and behaviorists to help overcome issues related to past trauma.\n\nIt is our belief that no injured or abused animal should lose its life simply due to lack of funds. We do not have our own shelter, and we will rely on volunteers, fosters and adopters to take the animals into their homes and provide them with proper care and nurturing.\n\nAll of our animals will be vaccinated, heartworm tested, micro-chipped and altered. All of our homes, foster or adopter, will be fully screened, including references and vet check, an interview with the applicant and a home visit to ensure the home is the right fit for the animal.\n\nOur outreach and education efforts will take place online via Facebook, web site and other social media as well as in person in the community via community events, school assemblies and any place people may lawfully gather to exchange information and learn.\n\nOur message is one teaching general animal care and welfare, population control through spay and neuter and disease control in the animal population via proper vaccinations.\n\n ","services":"adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":40.776100158691406,"lon":-73.95259857177734,"coordinates":"40.7761, -73.9526","citystate":"New York, NY"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"151","attributes":{"name":"Hound"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/151"}},{"type":"species","id":"8","attributes":{"singular":"Dog","plural":"Dogs","youngSingular":"Puppy","youngPlural":"Puppies"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/species\/8"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"45345406","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":70750,"resolutionX":480,"resolutionY":640,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7647\/pictures\/animals\/11432\/11432502\/45345406_480x640.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":70750,"resolutionX":480,"resolutionY":640,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7647\/pictures\/animals\/11432\/11432502\/45345406_480x640.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3303,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7647\/pictures\/animals\/11432\/11432502\/45345406_100x133.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2017-05-23T02:18:50Z","updated":"2017-05-23T02:19:04Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"45345408","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":67001,"resolutionX":480,"resolutionY":640,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7647\/pictures\/animals\/11432\/11432502\/45345408_480x640.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":67001,"resolutionX":480,"resolutionY":640,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7647\/pictures\/animals\/11432\/11432502\/45345408_480x640.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2953,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7647\/pictures\/animals\/11432\/11432502\/45345408_100x133.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2017-05-23T02:19:16Z","updated":"2017-05-23T02:19:16Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"7647","attributes":{"name":"Rescue Ridge","city":"Spring Lake","state":"NJ","postalcode":"07762","country":"United States","phone":"(732) 546-8805","email":"rescueridgeshelter@gmail.com","url":"http:\/\/www.rescueridge.com","facebookUrl":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/rescueridge","adoptionProcess":"COmplete an application, reveiw applications, do vet and personal references, meet with potential adopter.

","about":"Rescue Ridge is a highly recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit, no-kill animal rescue organization in Monmouth County, that has been steadily saving lives for over ten years.  Formed by the efforts of a local woman in 2001, Terri Willis committed her life to helping the animals of our community.  Born with a severe heart defect, Terri never allowed her disability to slow her down.  Her endless love, determination and dedication to all the animals was heartwarming and remarkable.  When she passed away, the animal community lost a great advocate and rescuer.  Although no longer with us, Terri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undying spirit continues on through her dream\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. The dream of Rescue Ridge.\n\nStaffed entirely by volunteers, Rescue Ridge relies exclusively on donations, sponsorships and fundraisers for support, which goes back to the animals.  With the help of our many followers and volunteers, we primarily serve the Monmouth and Ocean Counties of the Jersey Shore, but have gone much further to rescue animals in need.  Known in our area as the \u00e2\u0080\u009clast chance\u00e2\u0080\u009d rescue, we have taken in many animals slated for euthanasia by shelters.  Animals come to us from all over the communities we serve for many different reasons.  We have helped animals whose owners could no longer care for them due to age, illness, behavioral or economic reasons, keeping them out of the overcrowded shelters and adopting them back into loving homes.  We have never turned away a stray or any animal in distress.  We have taken in \u00e2\u0080\u009cdifficult\u00e2\u0080\u009d dogs that most other rescues or shelters would not even consider.  We take the time to socialize them, work with them and ultimately make them adoptable.\n\nOur vision is to take our efforts to a new level.  Committed to saving the lives of our community pets, Rescue Ridge is dedicated to the goal of introducing a no-kill shelter to Monmouth County.  Beyond a shelter, this safe haven for animals will offer our community the help it needs to finally put an end to the senseless deaths and unnecessary loss of life that these animals face daily.  Our focus will include education and affordable medical care to pet owners, keeping their animals healthy, comfortable and in their homes where they belong.  Never should a family have to surrender their pet to a shelter because they cannot afford their medical treatment.  We will also extend microchipping to our fellow animal lovers, making sure lost pets find their way home and not behind the bars of a shelter, where they can quickly wear out their welcome waiting for their family to find them.  We would be a proactive leader in putting an end to animal overpopulation by offering a true low cost spay\/neuter clinic.  A TNR (Trap & Release) Program would also be offered for feral cats, which would help keep the cat overpopulation to a minimum.  Our adoption center would be a safe and happy place, where families can come meet their new best friend.  Beyond all of this, we will offer affordable training and animal socialization to our communities, which will in turn, reinforce public safety and ensure the safety of our beloved pets.  This safe haven will be run by staff and our dedicated, experienced volunteers, many of whom have been with us for over ten years.\nBeing tremendous animal lovers, we all share the same belief that we can and we will make a difference, one animal at a time.  We know that this is not an easy task ahead, but there are many people and groups that will whole-heartedly support our efforts in making this happen.

Because we are a no-kill organization, we are also a \u201climited intake\u201d shelter.\n\nThe Leon County Humane Society works closely with other animal welfare agencies in the community and transfers animals in from other shelters that euthanize for space, including the Tallahassee Leon Community Animal Services Center (City Shelter). We do not take animals in from the public.\n\nOnce an animal is accepted in our foster and adoption program they are not euthanized for space reasons. Unless there are medical or behavioral issues that develop, deeming an animal un-adoptable, a cat or dog will stay in our adoption program until they find their forever home.\n\nTallahassee is an APSCA Partnership Community, and LCHS is thrilled to be one of the organizations included in this innovative program. Over the next 3-5 years, the Partnership organizations and ASPCA will be working together to reduce the homeless pet population in Tallahassee and provide much needed resources for the pets in our

We are an all breed rescue, and have a soft spot for bully breeds, medical cases and fear cases.  We pull primarily from the County Shelter's daily Euthanasia list and place animals in our approved foster homes. We then network these homeless pets in order to rehome them into loving families.  We require all adoption applicants to fill our our adoption application, receive a home visit, pay our adoption\/rehoming fee and sign our legal adoption contract.  All animals are fully vaccinated and altered prior to adoption being finalized. We do a standard 2 week Foster With Intent to Adopt trial period, in which the applicant has the opportunity to be sure the animal is a good fit for their

We are a home based foster group with no adoption facility. We adopt to North Carolina but in special circumstances can go out of state. We use every pro-bono means at our disposal to raise public awareness about homeless animals and responsible pet care as well as to find homes for our dogs. Dogs who are not adopted will live out their lives at Ruff Love.\n Ruff Love Rescue is run entirely by volunteers. We have full time jobs and save dogs in our spare time.

an adoption application before they meet the animals.  A vet reference will be done at that time (if applicable).  If meet is good animals will be brought to the home for home check and left with new family if all is well.  Our fee will be $300 for dog, $100 for cats.  Adoptions includes spay\/neuter, UTD on shots and Microchip.  Adoption contract will be signed when pet is brought to its new forever home.  ","about":"Tails of Hope is a non-profit, no-kill, volunteer animal rescue organization serving all of New Jersey who provides temporary shelter to stray, abandoned, and surrendered animals for the purpose of finding permanent suitable new homes. Our organization is totally run by people who generously volunteer their time, homes and hearts in order to help.\nWe make a promise to any animal who comes through our doors they will never be homeless again. We hope our residents will find a loving home with a lifelong companion or a loving family; but if they never find that home, they are welcomed into our family. \nWe provide spay and neuter services and any necessary medical care for pets. We work diligently to educate the public, especially children, on the importance of pet sterilization, responsible pet ownership and the humane treatment of animals. We assist all animals in distress without regard to age, breed or ease of placement. \nWe believe that with some temporary assistance, many animals can remain in their current homes instead of being admitted to animal shelters. We help by providing temporary supplies of pet food and other supplies to families suffering from unemployment, seniors on fixed incomes and families that are dealing with chronically illnesses where resources are tightly dedicated. \nWe strive to work with area shelters and other rescue and humane organizations to develop a network of supporters and volunteers in order to create a better world for homeless pets\n","services":"adoptions, spay\/neuter\/education","type":"Rescue","lat":40.26359939575195,"lon":-74.02169799804688,"coordinates":"40.2636, -74.0217","citystate":"Oakhurst, NJ"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"48","attributes":{"name":"Maine Coon"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/48"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"75121456","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":141759,"resolutionX":800,"resolutionY":899,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/75121456_800x899.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":54826,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":561,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/75121456_500x561.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4144,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":112,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/75121456_100x112.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2020-10-29T18:14:21Z","updated":"2020-12-12T00:28:23Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"75121455","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":169701,"resolutionX":800,"resolutionY":758,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/75121455_800x758.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":62622,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":473,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/75121455_500x473.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4277,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":94,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/75121455_100x94.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2020-10-29T18:13:05Z","updated":"2020-12-12T00:28:23Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"74008676","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":269182,"resolutionX":800,"resolutionY":1084,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/74008676_800x1084.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":93213,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":677,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/74008676_500x677.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":5346,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":135,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/74008676_100x135.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2020-08-21T14:56:38Z","updated":"2020-10-29T18:14:31Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"74131434","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":2277765,"resolutionX":3024,"resolutionY":4032,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/74131434_3024x4032.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":60667,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/74131434_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":5348,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/74131434_100x133.jpg"},"order":4,"created":"2020-08-29T15:42:09Z","updated":"2020-10-29T18:14:31Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"74131466","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":3548624,"resolutionX":3024,"resolutionY":4032,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/74131466_3024x4032.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":90725,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/74131466_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":5875,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/74131466_100x133.jpg"},"order":5,"created":"2020-08-29T15:51:18Z","updated":"2020-10-29T18:14:31Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"45932230","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":69311,"resolutionX":480,"resolutionY":640,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/45932230_480x640.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":69311,"resolutionX":480,"resolutionY":640,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/45932230_480x640.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4013,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/956\/pictures\/animals\/11512\/11512734\/45932230_100x133.jpg"},"order":6,"created":"2017-06-08T03:17:01Z","updated":"2020-10-29T18:14:31Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"956","attributes":{"name":"Eleventh Hour Rescue","street":"P.O.

We offer adoption, education, training, and rehabilitation services to ensure that unwanted and neglected animals are safe and receive the life-long care they require and deserve. We also promote responsible pet ownership; and offer prevention and intervention services to families afflicted by harsh economic conditions to ensure their pet(s) remain a part of the family. All animals in our care will receive any and all medical attention necessary and will not be adopted out without being spayed or neutered, given up-to-date on vaccinations, and being micro-chipped. In the event an adoption fails, or a family must surrender their pet, 4Life will always keep an open door and the animal will be taken in.\n \n \n \n4Life is a non-profit, entirely volunteer-based organization located in Orange County California, and we rely on the generosity of our volunteers, donors, and fundraisers to operate.  We fulfill our mission by collaborating with other rescues, our local shelters, veterinarians, boarding facilities, and local businesses.\n","services":"adoptions, training, advice","type":"Rescue","lat":33.8135986328125,"lon":-117.81900024414062,"coordinates":"33.8136, -117.819","citystate":"Orange, CA"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"80","attributes":{"name":"American Bulldog"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/80"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"46048129","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":148863,"resolutionX":563,"resolutionY":750,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048129_563x750.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":47779,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048129_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4332,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048129_100x133.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2017-06-11T20:02:54Z","updated":"2017-06-11T20:02:54Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"46048131","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":230346,"resolutionX":563,"resolutionY":750,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048131_563x750.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":71848,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048131_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":5055,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048131_100x133.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2017-06-11T20:02:54Z","updated":"2017-06-11T20:02:54Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"46048132","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":251197,"resolutionX":750,"resolutionY":563,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048132_750x563.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":47804,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":375,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048132_500x375.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3390,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":75,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048132_100x75.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2017-06-11T20:02:55Z","updated":"2017-06-11T20:02:55Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"46048133","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":207082,"resolutionX":563,"resolutionY":750,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048133_563x750.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":64010,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048133_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4865,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4450\/pictures\/animals\/11529\/11529861\/46048133_100x133.jpg"},"order":4,"created":"2017-06-11T20:02:56Z","updated":"2017-06-11T20:02:56Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"4450","attributes":{"name":"Forte Animal Rescue","street":"PO Box 10085","city":"Marina del Rey","state":"CA","postalcode":"90292","country":"United States","phone":"(310) 362-0321","email":"info@FARescue.org","url":"http:\/\/www.FARescue.org","facebookUrl":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/forteanimalrescue","adoptionProcess":"1.\tVolunteers at Forte Animal Rescue will work with you to identify your interests and needs in regards to a companion animal that would be suitable for your home. Our Adoption Questionnaire (PDF) for Dogs or Cats covers most of the issues which we have found relevant to helping you find your new companion and smooth the transition for both of you.\n2.\tAfter reading your questionnaire, one of our volunteers may make suggestions as to which animals may be best suited to you and your lifestyle and make an arrangement for you to meet them at our Weekend Adoptions or in their foster homes to get to know each other.\n3.\tIf you fall in love on the spot, please make sure you have read the \"Before You Adopt\" section because this is a big, and important decision, not just for the human involved, but also for the companion animal. We can then proceed with the next stop of the adoption process which is commonly called the \"Home Safety-Check\"\n4.\tAn Adoption Fee is required along with a signed adoption agreement, which ensures that if, for any reason, you are unable to keep the animal, he\/she is to be returned to Forte Animal Rescue only.\n5.\tFinally, we personally deliver your new family member to your home.","about":"Our Mission:\n\nTo inspire compassion and responsibility for animals, in addition to rescuing, rehabilitating and finding homes for companion animals.\n\nOur Profile:\n\nForte Animal Rescue is an all-volunteer 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, seeking solutions for pet-overpopulation, as well as working together with the community to cultivate the human-animal bond through educational programs and activities.\n\nOur Objectives:\n\n\tAfter years of work in animal rescue, we established this unique organization in January 2003 to function as a \"hub\" for people and the rescue community in order to help each other. We believe this is necessary in helping the rescue community to achieve its common goals of saving the lives of as many animals as possible.\n\n\tStop people from taking their animals to the pound through our Outreach Program by advising them of possible solutions, introducing them to appropriate trainers for their specific problems, or assisting them in finding new homes for their pets through our Adoption Program.\n\n\tServe as a liaison between animals and the general public. Our new educational program will help improve pet-people relations and understanding of responsibilities. This is especially important because lack of such knowledge is one of the direct causes of abandonment of companion animals.","services":"Adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":33.977901458740234,"lon":-118.44499969482422,"coordinates":"33.9779, -118.445","citystate":"Marina del Rey, CA"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"82","attributes":{"name":"American Staffordshire Terrier"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/82"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"46057229","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":3547029,"resolutionX":4608,"resolutionY":3072,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7739\/pictures\/animals\/11530\/11530813\/46057229_4608x3072.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":20866,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":333,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7739\/pictures\/animals\/11530\/11530813\/46057229_500x333.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2394,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":66,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7739\/pictures\/animals\/11530\/11530813\/46057229_100x66.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2017-06-12T05:19:05Z","updated":"2017-06-12T05:19:05Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"46057230","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":3633705,"resolutionX":4608,"resolutionY":3072,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7739\/pictures\/animals\/11530\/11530813\/46057230_4608x3072.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":19192,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":333,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7739\/pictures\/animals\/11530\/11530813\/46057230_500x333.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2272,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":66,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7739\/pictures\/animals\/11530\/11530813\/46057230_100x66.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2017-06-12T05:19:09Z","updated":"2017-06-12T05:19:09Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"46057231","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":3644759,"resolutionX":4608,"resolutionY":3072,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7739\/pictures\/animals\/11530\/11530813\/46057231_4608x3072.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":22384,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":333,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7739\/pictures\/animals\/11530\/11530813\/46057231_500x333.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2483,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":66,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7739\/pictures\/animals\/11530\/11530813\/46057231_100x66.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2017-06-12T05:19:14Z","updated":"2017-06-12T05:19:14Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"7739","attributes":{"name":"Cat Haven Rescue Inc","city":"Land O Lakes","state":"Fl","postalcode":"34639","country":"United States","email":"yodaflorida@yahoo.com","url":"http:\/\/cathavenrescueinc.com","facebookUrl":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/cathavenrescueinc","adoptionProcess":"fees range from $85.00 - $250.00 our contract states the cat will be indoor only and not declawed","about":"we are a small group of volunteers who work tirelessly to spay\/neuter every cat that crosses our path, rehome adoptable cats\/kittens, feed ferals and help the community to reduce the number of cats euthanized every day.

Most of the dogs we capture have spent the majority, if not their entire lives on the streets so are very elusive.  Once we get them into loving foster homes they adjust really well.  We help a lot of good samaritans who have fed stray dogs for months, even years but haven't been able to catch\/pet the dog.

Thankfully now, we've been working with our local animal control and they are finally not destroying all animals deemed feral. Unfortunately, there are still too many breeding animals (feral and domestic) that need help so we can stop the needless, mass reproduction. Sometimes that's a well-meaning individual who feeds cats and after a couple of years, realizes there is a problem, or it could be an elderly person who can't afford to vet their animals. The animals not only need our advocacy but occasionally the people we help do as well. We adopt the animals that can be adopted and find special placement for others that aren't so readily \"adoptable\".

If you are no longer able to care for your animal under any circumstances, it must be returned to Little Res Q. \n\nDue to the over population of pets that are found in rescues and the difficulty finding permanent placement for these species, breeding is prohibited for all species. You have been made aware that if you are caught selling and\/or breeding adopted animals that you will be banned from future adoption. \n\n\nPlease note:\n\nThe adoption fee varies depending on the animal; we do not give away free pets. The adoption fee for Sliders, Maps, and Cooters is $20.00. \n","about":"The Little RES Q is dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and relocation of exotic pet reptiles in an attempt to keep them from being released into the wild. We provide a better option for those who, for one reason or another, cannot take care of their reptiles anymore. Founded in 2008 by Marc Ouellette, the rescue started as a dedicated aquatic turtle shelter in Toronto and now accepts in most legal reptiles as space permits.\n\nMany small reptiles, especially turtles, get purchased as a pet for a young family member without fully understanding the costs in both material and time needed for proper care of the animal. Sadly all too often these poor creatures suffer from neglect even with the owner's best intentions.\n\nWe are a limited admittance shelter that restricts intake in order to uphold a standard in quality of life for the surrenders in our care. We implement a waiting list when necessary, use a foster care network to help, and emphasize adoption and responsible pet ownership for all types of reptiles.","services":"Adoptions, education, reptile parties","type":"Shelter","lat":44.3130989074707,"lon":-79.23049926757812,"coordinates":"44.3131, -79.2305","citystate":"Pefferlaw, ON"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"967","attributes":{"name":"Red-Eared Slider"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/967"}},{"type":"species","id":"41","attributes":{"singular":"Turtle","plural":"Turtles","youngSingular":"Hatchling","youngPlural":"Hatchlings"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/species\/41"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"47047166","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":48595,"resolutionX":271,"resolutionY":361,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7809\/pictures\/animals\/11683\/11683777\/47047166_271x361.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":48595,"resolutionX":271,"resolutionY":361,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7809\/pictures\/animals\/11683\/11683777\/47047166_271x361.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2932,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7809\/pictures\/animals\/11683\/11683777\/47047166_100x133.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2017-07-14T03:16:52Z","updated":"2017-07-14T03:16:52Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"7809","attributes":{"name":"Sweet Dream House Rescue","city":"Batavia","state":"OH","postalcode":"45245","country":"United States","phone":"(513) 484-9840","email":"dreamhouserescue@yahoo.com","url":"http:\/\/www.dreamhouserescue.org","facebookUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/...Dream-House-Rescue\/138219186271714","adoptionProcess":"We offer Foster To Adopt for dogs adoptions. \nYou must complete the application, be approved and pay a $100 deposit ($150 puppies).

In our first year, we helped 15 animals. In 2010, we helped 108 animals and in 2011, we helped 191 animals. We take animals in on surrender and pull from high-kill shelters, adopting to families that meet our requirements. We make a lifetime committment to our animals and require that, if the adoption doesn't work out, the pets are returned to us.

Our pets are microchipped,  vaccinated and spayed or neutered prior to adoption unless medically inadvisable.  If the pet isn't spayed or neutered we collect a $100 deposit which is refunded upon  receipt of proof of neuter.  Our adoption contract stipulates the pet must be kept up to date on vaccines and on heartworm preventatives.  We have no fees but do ask for a donation at the time of adoption.","about":"MarrVelous Pet Rescues & Adoptions (MPR) is a nonprofit 501(c)3 corporation officially formed in 2007 out of the love of animals shared by its founding members. Our mission is to unite homeless pets with loving homes and families. The organization is comprised of a \"virtual shelter\" based out of Marr Properties in Key Largo, Florida. This virtual shelter is a local network of foster families who are dedicated to take in, care for and if needed, rehabilitate or socialize animals in need until they are ready to be placed in permanent loving forever homes. Funding for these services comes solely from donations, which are fully tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. \n\nAnimals we adopt out often come to us having been abandoned or relinquished. Some may have injuries, health issues or other medical needs requiring veterinary care, antibiotics or other medications. If no medical history is available, a wellness exam is done, vaccines administered and preventive medications are started. Occasionally there will be behavioral or emotional issues that need to be addressed - perhaps the pet has been neglected or abused and needs to re-learn to trust. And sometimes the animals who come to our care are perfectly happy, healthy, fully trained and respectable little souls who, through no fault of their own, are suddently in need of a new home. \n\nThe stories are plentiful and the needs are vast. Our foster families, with the assistance of loca veterinarians, take great care in making sure these needs are met. Funding for these services and needs come soley from donations. If you are interested in becoming a foster family for MPR, go to our website and complete an application. Someone will contact you to discuss what it takes to be a foster host family. Learn the rewards that come from lending a hand.

We are 501(c)(3) tax exempt, incorporated with the State of Georgia and approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.\n\nWe work to reduce animal population through spay\/neuter. Promote responsible pet ownership including vaccinations and humane education and seek suitable homes for unwanted and neglected animals.\n\nThe purpose of Street Paws, Inc. is to work with local county animal control shelters, county government and other animal groups for the prevention of cruelty to animals, the relief of suffering among animals, including the reduction of animal overpopulation through spay\/neuters and publicizing the benefit thereof; promote responsible pet ownership including vaccinations, improve the lives of animals living on the streets, provide humane education to the citizenry and foster a healthy relationship between people and animals.\n\nStreet Paws, Inc. shall assist to house homeless, neglected and abused animals, provide veterinary care, seek suitable homes for animals without owners; support local shelters to maximize reclaims, adoptions and foster opportunities, to reduce euthanasia, transfer animals to other licensed animal rescue groups; and provide euthanasia when necessary.  These animals are surrendered or given to Street Paws, Inc. by their owners, animal shelters, Humane Societies, and other persons.\n\nStreet Paws, Inc. is out on the streets daily taking a progressive, proactive approach to establishing a permanent resolution to the stray companion animal problem through dedicated rescue efforts, sheltering, community outreach programs, education, collaborations, and the encouragement of responsible pet guardianship.\n\nStreet Paws Mission Statement:\n\nAny animal we come across who finds themselves without a home will not go hungry or unloved. When funds and space allow, Street Paws will take the homeless animal under our wing, notify the proper authorities, network them and try to find them a new home. We will care for and provide comfort and aid to homeless pets in a variety of ways. If the animal is tame, we will network to find a home for them. If the animal is feral, we will feed and care for the animal in their own environment. Every action will be taken to provide the animal(s) with a proper diet and bedding. Spaying and neutering these ferals is of great importance to us. We will do what we can to ensure the feral population will be kept to a minimum. We also seek to educate pet owners about the importance of spaying and neutering, annual vaccinations and the importance of a true commitment to their pet as a family member to help ensure their pet does not become another homeless statistic as well.\n\nOur current activities include:\n\nTrap-Neuter-Return (TNR) for semi-feral and feral cats. We work to get all the animals sterilized so that the overpopulation and spread of diseases is averted. Food and water stations are set up to maintain the colonies. We do not release animals that are sick or not healthy. All cats are given rabies shots prior to release. We have now sterilized 351 kitties as of February 2017. After the recommended post-op period is completed then the feral is returned to their colony. A volunteer Colony Caretaker is assigned the task of providing fresh food and water daily to ensure the quality of life for the returned ferals.\n\nFood and water program for stray, semi-feral and feral dogs. The food and water program is a network of volunteers working to sustain homeless animals that still await rescue. We supply feeders with food, when available. Volunteers drive to stations, replenish food and water and collect field data to assist with caring for the animals until a permanent solution can be found. The feeding program is critical to the animals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 survival, as well as their health and well being while they wait to be humanely trapped, spayed and neutered and rehabilitated.\n\nEducation- Street Paws, Inc. has developed specific information about the practice of Trap-Neuter-Return of feral felines, spay\/neuter, heartworms, vaccinations and a new dog fact sheet and disseminate this information via our website, flyers, and education for children in schools. We have partnered with the Southern Crescent Habitat for Humanity to provide animal welfare education to new homeowners on a quarterly basis.\n\nAs of February 2017 we currently have 12 dogs, 2 puppies and 15 cats, 6 kittens in our foster program. We have multiple cat colonies at this time (currently 11 colonies and apx 50 cats) in very populated areas such as Waffle House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Skybox, Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Healthcare, Sun Suites, a cemetery, Marathon gas station, Mobile gas station and Burger King. We rescued 117 dogs\/puppies and adopted out 103 dogs\/puppies. We rescued 54 cats\/kittens and have adopted out 33\/cats\/kittens from 2014-2017.","services":"Adoptions ","type":"Rescue","lat":33.340301513671875,"lon":-84.12159729003906,"coordinates":"33.3403,

Illinois area.  We strongly advocate that animals are spayed or neutered regardless of breed, sex or age.  Our program offers spay and neuter assistance and basic veterinary treatment - including flea and parasite treatment and routine vaccinations - to needy or unowned animals.  We also provide humane education to community and civic groups on the care of animals and the importance of spaying\/neutering in population control.\nWe have a limited intake, no-kill adoption program.  Most animals are transferred from municipal animal control facilities.  All animals are in foster homes or at an off-site adoption partner site.  Animals are never euthanized for space.  At CATsNAP, our goal is to promote successful pet ownership and place animals in a loving, pet friendly home.\n","services":"spay, neuter, adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":40.11330032348633,"lon":-88.24169921875,"coordinates":"40.1133, -88.2417","citystate":"Champaign, IL"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"47989990","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":5744651,"resolutionX":4032,"resolutionY":3024,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47989990_4032x3024.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":61874,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":375,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47989990_500x375.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3208,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":75,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47989990_100x75.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2017-08-09T20:54:06Z","updated":"2017-08-09T20:58:00Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"47464502","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":2065530,"resolutionX":2753,"resolutionY":2465,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47464502_2753x2465.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":30871,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":447,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47464502_500x447.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2928,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":89,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47464502_100x89.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2017-07-26T18:04:07Z","updated":"2017-08-09T20:58:00Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"47989769","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":6211025,"resolutionX":4032,"resolutionY":3024,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47989769_4032x3024.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":65050,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":375,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47989769_500x375.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2950,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":75,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47989769_100x75.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2017-08-09T20:48:29Z","updated":"2017-08-09T20:57:52Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"47989775","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":5811458,"resolutionX":4032,"resolutionY":3024,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47989775_4032x3024.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":66794,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":375,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47989775_500x375.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3225,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":75,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1617\/pictures\/animals\/11781\/11781246\/47989775_100x75.jpg"},"order":4,"created":"2017-08-09T20:49:35Z","updated":"2017-08-09T20:57:41Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"1617","attributes":{"name":"Helping Shepherds of Every Color","city":"Montgomery","state":"AL","postalcode":"36107","country":"United States","email":"everycolorrescue@yahoo.com","url":"http:\/\/www.helpingshepherdsofeverycolor.com","adoptionProcess":"Adotpion application, reference and vet reference check, home visit, adoption contract, adoption fee (amount varies depending on the animal).","about":"We are Helping Shepherds of Every Color.

application that requires the potential adopter to wait 24 hours until their application can be verified. Once everything checks out the adopter comes and picks up their new fur member of the family and signs a contract. One of the highlights of our contract states that if for ANY reason at ANY time they cannot care for the animal, they must return the cat or dog back to Colony Cats (& dogs). Our adoption fees are $75.- for kittens (6 months and younger), $65.- for cats, $45.- for Wise Whiskers (7 years and older). We often have adoption specials where the adoption fees are lowered. The adoption fee includes the animals already being spayed\/neutered, Feline Leukemia tested (cats), Heartworm tested (cats and dogs), all vaccinations (FVRCP and DHLPP), rabies vaccine (if kittens or puppies adopted are not old enough to have received a rabies vaccine, then the new owner can bring them back for that at no extra cost), microchip, flea\/tick\/heartworm preventative.","about":"We are a 501c3, non-profit, all volunteer animal rescue and welfare organization. We are dedicated to ending the explosion of homeless pets in this area; through low cost (sometimes no cost) spay\/neuter, public education\/awareness, rescue\/adoption and support for feral\/stray cats and their caregivers. We do this because there is an epidemic of abused, neglected, abandoned animals throughout Central Ohio. As a compassionate organization we are striving to end this suffering for them.

Once rehabilitated and ready, they are carefully matched with prospective adopters and placed in loving homes. Over 23,000 pets have been adopted from Animal House Shelter.\n\nLike people, animals have distinct personalities that make them unique. At Animal House Shelter, we are proud to say that the dogs and cats are treated like our own. We care enough to be certain they are treated with the comfort and respect that they deserve and we make every effort to ensure that they go to the right, forever, permanent, loving home.\n\nThe best possible veterinary care is always given to Animal House Shelter pets and treatment is never declined if it will give the animal a chance for a healthy life. Socializing and keeping our pets happy is also of utmost importance. Dogs are walked 4-5 times daily and cats are housed in a large, whimsical, free-roam habitat All are given loving care and attention by staff and volunteers.\n\n All dogs and cats are given all vaccinations- including their Rabies vaccine if old enough. They are neutered,  microchipped,  dewormed and heartworm tested (Dogs)  or FeLV\/FIV tested (Cats). Dogs are kept on heartworm preventative & all animals receive Frontline Plus monthly by Animal House.\n\nAnimal House takes in many special needs animals.  We take care of any ailment or surgery that needs to be done on any animal we rescue including, but not limited to: heart worm treatments, cruciate ligament repair, patella surgery, FHO, heart surgery, diabetes, anxiety disorders, auto immune deficiencies, liver shunts etc.  On average, AHS takes in at least one animal per week that has one of the above ailments or needs surgery.  We do not believe that any animal should be left to be euthanized at a high kill facility because they are sick or injured.  Society has already failed them at one point in time and someone needs to speak up and rescue those that are defenseless and without a voice.  That is who we are are and that is what Animal House Shelter has always been about.

for animals.  Located in Huddleston, VA, we are truly in the heart of Virginia \u2013 30 minutes from Lynchburg, 30 minutes from Smith Mountain Lake, 30 minutes from Bedford, and 60 minutes from Roanoke.\n\nOur motto is \u201cRescue \u2026 rehome \u2026 real love\u201d and we try to live it every day.  We rescue animals in need of new homes and loving families.  We make sure each of them is spayed or neutered and up-to-date on all routine vaccinations.  If other medical care or treatment is needed, we get that for them as well.  \n\nWe welcome them into our homes and our lives and really get to know their personalities and their needs.  Then we make it our mission to re-home them \u2026 and to place them in the forever home that will be perfect for them.  Some of them really need to have another pup companion while others will do fine being an \u2018only pet.\u2019  Some love having children to play with while others prefer being with adult people.  Some do well sharing a home with cats or other small pets while others, well \u2026 not so much.  And the only way you know this is by living with them!  \n\nWe also work to educate and encourage pet owners to spay or neuter their animals to a) help their pets lead longer, healthier lives and b) help reduce the numbers of homeless and unwanted animals in our Central Virginia communities.  It is such an easy thing to do!  Not only will it benefit your pet and your family, but it will help reduce the numbers of wonderful, adoptable animals that are euthanized every year.

We are making a difference where we can by saving lives. \n","services":"adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":43.56949996948242,"lon":-116.40399932861328,"coordinates":"43.5695,

based in Illinois and Northwest Indiana. A core group of volunteers live in the Chicago Suburbs and surrounding Chicagoland area. As a small non-profit, Fur Angels works tirelessly to giving all animals a second chance at finding a forever home. Without having an actual shelter, we have many volunteers who have opened their homes to exotic animals and some with special needs. This rescue is unique because we foster many animals deemed unadoptable. We rescue dogs, cats, birds, bunnies, reptiles, turtles, hedgehogs, guinea pigs, rodents, fish and more!

Demographics indicate low education and economic levels leading to high incidence of animal abuse, neglect, abandonment, dog fighting, etc. Prior to our organization becoming active about 1500 dogs\/cats were euthanized each year. Since inception in 2011, we have been able to curtail the number of animals euthanized in 1\/2. Last year, 750 animals were put to sleep. The community has responded well to our approach of offering LOW COST s\/n vouchers which is now a self-promoting process.","services":"Low Cost Spay\/NeuterVouchers, Emergency Veterinary Assistance,

We decided to form a non-profit rescue so that we could fundraise to support our mission. Dot's mission is to provide a permanent home at Dot's Old Dogs Home for large-breed senior dogs whose owners have died or gone into a nursing home. These dogs do not do well in shelters, and will not get adopted. At our sanctuary, these dogs have a promise of a forever home, but are also promoted for adoption because there's nothing better than your very own human. Jeanne Lou's mission is to rescue chained\/penned and yard-sale dogs. A lot of these dogs tend to be the smaller breeds, thus the name, Little Big Dog, because we rescue the little ones and the big ones. Jeanne Lou's rescues are placed in foster homes, vetted, s\/n'd, socialized, and offered for adoption.","services":"We vet, treat medical conditions, and s\/n animals before they are adopted

All pets are kept in foster homes until adoption.  These foster homes are inspected twice a year.  Awf came into existence in 2003.  We are a no-kill shelter which means we have limited admission.  Prior to our existence in 2003, all stray dogs not reclaimed were euthanized.  Since 2003, not one adoptable dog has been put down.  We are an all-volunteer organization made up of animal-loving residents of the community that want to help all pets get a loving home for

The mission is to provide temporary housing to stray, unwanted and neglected cats and dogs until permanent loving homes can be found.  Our mission also includes controlling the pet overpopulation through low cost spay\/neuter programs.  We offer local low cost spay\/neuter programs for companion animals and low cost spay\/neuter programs for feral free roaming cats.  We actively participate in humane education programs with a group of volunteers from surrounding counties to elementary and high schools those counties.  BCHS was formed because we saw a need for improving animal welfare in Bond County.","services":"adoptions, spay\/neuter, humane

must fill out an application at www.adoptapitrescue.org\/apply. We screen all applications, with approved applicants passing a vet and landlord check. All pets in the home must be spayed\/neutered and up to date on all vaccinations and on year-round heartworm preventative. Non-homeowners must have permission from their landlord to have a dog. Once approved, we schedule a home visit, where an adoption representative takes the dog to the adopter's home to see if the dog is a good fit for the family and other pets, as well as verify the home is a safe environment for the dog. If everyone feels the dog is a good fit, a contract is signed, adoption fee is paid, and the family takes possession of the dog, unless other arrangements are made. Typical adoption fees are $175 for adult dogs and $200 for puppies. We reserve the right to charge different fees for \"designer\" breeds. All of our dogs are spayed\/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested, and on heartworm preventative at the time of adoption. All dogs have been examined by our veterinarian and given a clean bill of health at the time of adoption.","about":"Adopt a Pit Rescue, Inc. is the largest Pit Bull rescue in the Miami Valley. We save, rehabilitate, & rehome dogs from local kill shelters. When we have space, we take in owner surrenders or lost dogs rescued by community members. Founded in 2013 to rescue and rehabilitate Pit Bulls & other \"bully breeds\", we have since adopted out over 1600 dogs, and currently have around 115 adoptable dogs in over 60 foster homes. The majority of our dogs come from high kill shelters, where they are quite literally on death row. We focus on dogs who are deemed \"unadoptable\" at the shelters due to injuries, illness, because they are scared, or simply because of their breed. \u00e2\u0080\u008bWe try to focus on our local animal shelter, but will transport dogs from other counties when we have available fosters. We are currently the only rescue pulling pit bulls from our local shelter. Our Board of Directors is 2 very dedicated women who do not receive any payment for what they do. They each have a house full of difficult dogs that they take because no one else will. They work tirelessly to correct behavior to get them ready for their forever homes. We have a network of fantastic volunteers who foster, transport, perform adoptions, help with our rescue sites, and do all the other necessary things to keep the rescue running. We rely on donations and adoption fees to pay for everything our dogs need.","services":"Adoptions, collaborate to provide spay\/neuter clinic through Rascal Unit","type":"Rescue","lat":39.63090133666992,"lon":-84.39530181884766,"coordinates":"39.6309, -84.3953","citystate":"Germantown, OH"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"56593884","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":48163,"resolutionX":533,"resolutionY":960,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2152\/pictures\/animals\/12437\/12437771\/56593884_533x960.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":47508,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":900,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2152\/pictures\/animals\/12437\/12437771\/56593884_500x900.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4893,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":180,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2152\/pictures\/animals\/12437\/12437771\/56593884_100x180.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2018-04-28T15:31:25Z","updated":"2018-04-28T15:31:54Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"53385547","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":1528084,"resolutionX":1764,"resolutionY":3134,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2152\/pictures\/animals\/12437\/12437771\/53385547_1764x3134.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":106452,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":888,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2152\/pictures\/animals\/12437\/12437771\/53385547_500x888.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":5235,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":177,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2152\/pictures\/animals\/12437\/12437771\/53385547_100x177.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2018-01-04T17:44:30Z","updated":"2018-04-28T15:31:54Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"56593886","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":79593,"resolutionX":533,"resolutionY":795,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2152\/pictures\/animals\/12437\/12437771\/56593886_533x795.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":50574,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":745,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2152\/pictures\/animals\/12437\/12437771\/56593886_500x745.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3888,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":149,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2152\/pictures\/animals\/12437\/12437771\/56593886_100x149.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2018-04-28T15:31:25Z","updated":"2018-04-28T15:31:25Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"2152","attributes":{"name":"Missouri German Shepherd Rescue","street":"PO Box 22466","city":"Kansas City","state":"MO","postalcode":"64113","country":"United States","email":"mogsrescue@gmail.com","url":"http:\/\/www.mogsrescue.com","facebookUrl":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MOGS.Rescue","adoptionProcess":"Homes will be required to provide 3 references plus a Vet reference and have a home visit completed.

Abandoned or homeless Boxers will always find shelter, medical care, and ultimately a new home through the efforts of NWBR. By working with committed volunteers and local veterinarians we are able to rescue boxers every year, provide them with loving temporary foster care, and find them perfect loving forever homes. Working in conjunction with city and county groups, NWBR strives to educate the public and help end animal overpopulation and needless suffering. The commitment to share the love of Boxers is never ending. \nWe never discriminate on the basis of health or age.

An important part of our mission is to help families with children adopt dogs, instead of using breeders, as these families often have a difficult time adopting from municipal shelters because of restrictions required by the shelters. We rescue almost all types of dogs including bully breeds and we make it a point to provide appropriate veterinary care.  We often take dogs who have medical issues, or are deaf or otherwise \"less than perfect\".","services":"Adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":37.775299072265625,"lon":-122.41899871826172,"coordinates":"37.7753, -122.419","citystate":"San Francisco, CA"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"79","attributes":{"name":"Alaskan Malamute"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/79"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"55453546","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":24457,"resolutionX":361,"resolutionY":271,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/8716\/pictures\/animals\/12489\/12489769\/55453546_361x271.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":24457,"resolutionX":361,"resolutionY":271,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/8716\/pictures\/animals\/12489\/12489769\/55453546_361x271.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2490,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":75,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/8716\/pictures\/animals\/12489\/12489769\/55453546_100x75.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2018-03-14T16:00:21Z","updated":"2018-03-14T16:01:25Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"53898031","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":4843079,"resolutionX":2590,"resolutionY":2507,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/8716\/pictures\/animals\/12489\/12489769\/53898031_2590x2507.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":57801,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":483,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/8716\/pictures\/animals\/12489\/12489769\/53898031_500x483.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3208,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":96,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/8716\/pictures\/animals\/12489\/12489769\/53898031_100x96.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2018-01-19T18:22:05Z","updated":"2018-03-14T16:01:25Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"53898030","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":2938913,"resolutionX":4032,"resolutionY":3024,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/8716\/pictures\/animals\/12489\/12489769\/53898030_4032x3024.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":26033,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":375,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/8716\/pictures\/animals\/12489\/12489769\/53898030_500x375.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2479,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":75,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/8716\/pictures\/animals\/12489\/12489769\/53898030_100x75.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2018-01-19T18:22:03Z","updated":"2018-03-14T16:01:25Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"8716","attributes":{"name":"The Cat Network, Inc.","street":"P.O.

Each chapter operates individually.  We are Cats In Need of Human Care in Whittier, commonly known as CIN Whittier.  If you are interested in fostering or adopting, please contact us.  The more fosters we have, the more lives we can save!  We also are the only CIN location to have a internship program where middle school and high school students (with adult supervision) come and spend time with cats, allowing them human interaction, exercise, and much needed love.\nCats In Need of Human Care Whittier Chapter services Whittier and the surrounding cities, although we do get people from many different areas interested in adoption.\n\nAdoption fees range from $100-$150.  Fees charges are to cover basic care, food, spay \/ neutering, vaccinations, vet visits costs.  potential adopters are to complete an adoption form and we will determine if you and your desired cat are a good match.  Questions that may be asked:  will your pet be outdoors, declawed, are there other pets or children in the house.\n\nIn the unfortunate event that your beloved kitty does not fit into your home, we require that he\/she be returned to Cats In Need Whittier.\n\nOur adoption hours are every weekend, Saturday and Sunday from noon \u00e2\u0080\u0093 5pm.  We are located inside PetSmart Whittier.\n\nDownload the pet adoption form:\nhttp:\/\/www.catsinneed.com\/downloads\/AdoptionApplication-2013.pdf\n\nCats In Need of Human Care is an organization of volunteers who co-operate with one another and the community to find good, loving homes for homeless pets, promote spay\/neuter and responsible ownership.\nCats in Need is a completely volunteer run organization that focus on adopting kitties into great forever homes.  We showcase our fosters online through our Facebook Page (Cats In Need)  as well as through RescueMe.org & AdoptAPet.com.\n\nWe depend on donations to cover the basics: food, medical care (shots and spay\/neuter) for the kitties until they go home to their new families. With the shelters overtaxed, many of these kitties would likely be killed due to sheer population overload and not enough public funds to support them.\n\nHelp us help the kitties!","services":"Adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":33.94710159301758,"lon":-117.99500274658203,"coordinates":"33.9471, -117.995","citystate":"Whittier, CA"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"78249430","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":61944,"resolutionX":360,"resolutionY":480,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/12699\/12699405\/78249430_360x480.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":61944,"resolutionX":360,"resolutionY":480,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/12699\/12699405\/78249430_360x480.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":5396,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/12699\/12699405\/78249430_100x133.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2021-04-26T11:54:40Z","updated":"2021-04-26T11:54:40Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"55532839","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":2444652,"resolutionX":4032,"resolutionY":3024,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/12699\/12699405\/55532839_4032x3024.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":62475,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":375,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/12699\/12699405\/55532839_500x375.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3555,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":75,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/12699\/12699405\/55532839_100x75.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2018-03-17T14:35:19Z","updated":"2021-04-26T11:54:40Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"55532864","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":2457903,"resolutionX":4032,"resolutionY":3024,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/12699\/12699405\/55532864_4032x3024.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":59315,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":375,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/12699\/12699405\/55532864_500x375.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3434,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":75,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4442\/pictures\/animals\/12699\/12699405\/55532864_100x75.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2018-03-17T14:35:23Z","updated":"2021-04-26T11:54:40Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"4442","attributes":{"name":"Castoff Pet Rescue","city":"Blairsville","state":"GA","postalcode":"30512","country":"United States","phone":"(706) 487-4539","email":"info@castoffpetrescue.org","url":"http:\/\/castoffpetrescue.org\/","facebookUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CastoffPetRescue\/","adoptionProcess":"Adoption fees vary for cats and dogs.

Years of rescue showed us that the senior demographic in shelters is often the most overlooked and highly euthanized. These animals are discarded because of failing health, new pets in the family, a lack of time for attention and care, and countless other reasons which Good Old Tails finds deplorable. Pets are a commitment for life, not until they are an inconvenience. We are dedicated to saving as many senior dogs and cats as we can, and providing them with love and care so that they can live out the rest of their days with dignity and happiness. Some of these animals may never leave our rescue, and their foster families will be the ones to say the last good-bye. Others will go on to find families of their own. Whatever the outcome, we have made the promise to them that they will never again be alone.","services":"Adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":39.86140060424805,"lon":-76.7562026977539,"coordinates":"39.8614, -76.7562","citystate":"Seven Valleys, PA"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"55329474","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":24815,"resolutionX":316,"resolutionY":562,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329474_316x562.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":24815,"resolutionX":316,"resolutionY":562,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329474_316x562.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4719,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":177,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329474_100x177.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2018-03-09T23:37:40Z","updated":"2018-03-09T23:37:40Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"55329475","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":16474,"resolutionX":253,"resolutionY":450,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329475_253x450.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":16474,"resolutionX":253,"resolutionY":450,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329475_253x450.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4621,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":177,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329475_100x177.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2018-03-09T23:37:41Z","updated":"2018-03-09T23:37:41Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"55329476","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":156102,"resolutionX":600,"resolutionY":800,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329476_600x800.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":45909,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329476_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3216,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329476_100x133.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2018-03-09T23:37:41Z","updated":"2018-03-09T23:37:41Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"55329477","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":15483,"resolutionX":253,"resolutionY":450,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329477_253x450.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":15483,"resolutionX":253,"resolutionY":450,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329477_253x450.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4479,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":177,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/4002\/pictures\/animals\/12760\/12760314\/55329477_100x177.jpg"},"order":4,"created":"2018-03-09T23:37:41Z","updated":"2018-03-09T23:37:41Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"4002","attributes":{"name":"Rose's Rescue","street":"P O Box 33","city":"Rootstown","state":"OH","postalcode":"44272","country":"United States","phone":"(330) 850-7042","email":"email@rosesrescue.net","url":"www.rosesrescue.net","facebookUrl":" http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/group.php?gid=124999791224","adoptionProcess":"The first step to adopting is to fill out the Online Adoption Application  at www.rosesrescue.net.

Our dogs are in area foster homes or they are housed at Rose's..in a heated pole building with a \"bedroom\" (toddler beds, a chair and a radio..so they can keep up on current events) with a dog door to a small fenced area to potty in through out the day and night. Then they get to play in a four acre fenced in area and swim in the pond every day too! We do not have a \"shelter\" per se and only under special circumstances are any of our animals \"kenneled\". They are very well socialized with people and other animals, which makes it much easier to know their temperaments. We do NOT take owner surrenders. But we will do courtesy posts for pets that are vetted and in need of homes. OUR MISSION STATEMENT Rose's Rescue is an all breed rescue for dogs and cats. We primarily concentrate on local pound rescues as we feel these are the animals in the most dire need of a second chance. We are committed to finding the best possible home for each, and every animal that comes into our rescue and we are available to help with any training or behavioral issues for the life of each animal. Rose's Rescue requires that any animal adopted through our organization be returned to us if for any reason the family is no longer able to care for them. Rose's Rescue is also committed to educating the public on the importance of spay and neuter, routine vaccinations, heartworm protection for dogs, and aids and leukemia testing for cats. According to the Humane Society of American over 4 million dogs, cats, kittens and puppies are killed each year. It is our goal to some day see no adoptable pets euthanized.\nEvery two months, Rose\u2019s Rescue chooses a few special candidates for a new class of dogs to be trained at the Trumbull Correctional Institution near Warren, Ohio.  While enrolled in this program, each dog will be trained by selected inmates and overseen by professional dog trainer Bill Oliver (www.customcaninecompany.com) who generously volunteers his time with this laudable project.  Upon completion of their training, cell dogs will have learned important socialization skills, have mastered basic obedience commands, and be fully housebroken.  They will also be taught tricks to entertain their future families and friends, such as sitting pretty, playing dead, and give a high five.  All dogs can be visited (by appointment and accompanied by a Rose\u2019s Rescue representative) while at the prison.  They can be adopted upon graduation, or occasionally sooner if a dog has done exceptionally well and is deemed ready to leave before the class is actually finished.  All of our current cell dogs or graduates are designated as such in their individual descriptions in the \u201cOur Adoptables\u201d section of this website.  If you\u2019d like to get a jump-start on training your new pet, consider adopting a Rose\u2019s Rescue cell dog!

Email or call us about which animal you are considering and we can make an appointment for you and the animal to meet. Visit the Adoption Information page at www.mshoogys.org to fill out our adoption application and email it to one of our volunteers. You can also print a copy, fill it out, and bring it with you to M'Shoogy's during our hours of operation, which are Saturdays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. Please note that if you are applying to adopt a dog, we usually require that you have a fenced-in yard except in special situations.\n\nThe cost to adopt is just $59 which includes shots and the cost of spaying\/neutering. If you are adopting a dog we also ask that you purchase 6 months of heartworm preventative. It is sold by weight. If you check around, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find it is the lowest cost adoption service in the area.","about":"With a strict no-kill policy, several hundred dogs, cats and other animals of all ages and sizes call M'Shoogy's home. It costs approximately $50.00 per month per animal, excluding  medicine, and approximately $500.00 per day to open the door.  In over 19 years, we have saved more than 15,000 animals from certain death.\n\nGary and Lisa Silverglat started M'Shoogy's and have given and lived a 24 hour commitment to the animals. They have had four days away from the Sanctuary in 19 years. They have never taken a salary for themselves, only given everything they have with no thought of monetary compensation.  There are also other individuals, volunteers, and employees who help provide care and love for the animals.\n\nSeveral acres in the back are also dedicated to wildlife rehabilitation. Many animals are given medical attention and food until they are old enough and\/or well enough to be reintroduced into the wild. Summer and spring brings around a large amount of raccoons and possums. Fox, owls, deer, squirrels and ducks have all called M'Shoogy's home for a little while.\n\n\nM'Shoogy's also provides educational tours and talks for groups to teach the importance of treating animals with dignity and respect.

This gives us a chance to find out a little bit about you and to make sure the dog you are interested in will be a good match for your family and lifestyle.\n\nIf it looks like a good match, we will set up a time to come to your house for a home inspection. This allows us to make sure your home will be a safe, secure place for the dog... and it gives you a chance to see how the dog will interact with other pets and members of your family. Because of this policy, adoptions are generally restricted to the Los Angeles area and, in some cases, to other parts of Southern Califonia only.  (We do occasionally make exceptions for \"the perfect match\", but the home must still be within reasonable driving distance).\n\nOur adoption fees range from $150 to $300 for non-puppy mill dogs and from $300 to $500 for puppy mill dogs.  Our puppy mill dogs are costing us thousands of dollars because they were never treated medically, so we must charge more for them.  This is a tax-deductible donation to our organization, and it goes towards the rescue, rehabilitation and care and long term stay of other dogs in the program.  The fee is non-refundable.  All of the dogs are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and given a veterinary check-up and grooming before they are placed in new homes.\n\nPlease Note: Our adoption application is very thorough and takes several minutes to complete. Please read the following Adoption Procedures before you fill it out.\n\nPlease contact us to get a copy of our adoption procedures and application at (661) 713-5240 or email us at brittany_dogs@yahoo.com and we can fax, email, or mail one to you. Fax the completed form to us at (661) 554-0220.","about":"The Brittany Foundation is a public charity which rescues, rehabilitates, rehomes and provides safe shelter for homeless dogs. Our rescue efforts focus on dogs which no one else might adopt from \"kill\" shelters, such as geriatric, disabled, severe neglect dogs. We also rescue puppy mill victims, strays and dogs from foreclosure and hospice situations.  In addition to being a rescue, we are also a sanctuary for those dogs who might never be adopted. We care for them for life.","services":"Adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":34.467899322509766,"lon":-118.18199920654297,"coordinates":"34.4679, -118.182","citystate":"Acton,

Our contract requires that the adopted kitty be indoor only, not declawed, have a back-up microchip phone number and person, among other clauses. We conduct an interview, and watch the family interact with the kitty. If everything goes well, we ask a $125 adoption fee for kittens and $75 for cats 18 months and older. We require all members of the household to be present for the interaction so we can see how the kitty responds with each person and vice-versa, that there are no allergic reactions, and that all family members are on-board with the adoption and kitty selected.  We do this to minimize the risk of the kitty being returned and to make sure there are no allergy issues. If renting, we ask for a copy of the rental agreement showing pets are allowed, a letter from the landlord stating adopting this kitty is allowed or a phone call with the landlord will also be okay.","about":"FOSMAS is an IRS-registered 501(c)(3) charity whose primary goal is to lower the euthanasia rate at the shelter, reduce the overpopulation of homeless cats, and provide public outreach services to help the animals in surrounding communities. We can accomplish this goal by increasing adoptions and expanding our volunteer program. We provide homes, medical and comfort care to all animals in foster care until adopted.\n\nWe provide specialty services for care of pre-wean kittens, we train fosters in animal care and provide foster homes for those that choose to volunteer. FOSMAS provides all necessary food, supplies, and medical treatments for the pets it places in foster homes. We place them in adoption centers and holds pet fairs to find forever homes for the pets in our foster system.\n\n","services":" adoptions, volunteer programs, information and financial support for

Arizona corporation. We find loving homes for stray dogs and dogs on euthanasia lists at kill shelters throughout the state. At this time we do not take owner turn ins. We are simply too small and do not have the resources. Once we determine that the animal has no owner (if it is a stray) we place the dog in a boarding facility or foster home where the dog can receive the tender loving care he or she desperately needs. This always requires a veterinary check up, vaccinations, and usually a spay or neuter surgery. Once the animal is healthy, we seek a loving home where he or she can live out their life in happiness.","services":"Adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":33.22629928588867,"lon":-111.78500366210938,"coordinates":"33.2263, -111.785","citystate":"CHANDLER, AZ"}}]}
