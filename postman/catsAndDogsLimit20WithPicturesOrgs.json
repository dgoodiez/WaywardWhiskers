Stu currently lives with two other dogs and is fine most of the time &quot;occasionally rude to male&quot; but he does not do well with cats. He is food reactive and would do best in a home with kids 13 yrs. or older. He has some separation anxiety but that has been easy managed with proper medication. Stu is very well socialized with people, is eager to please and is food motivated. He is smart and responds well to training. He knows sit, wait, release command (&ldquo;okay&rdquo;) and does well on a harness lead for walks. He is about 6.5 years old and crate and house trained.<\/p>\n\n<p>Stu&rsquo;s adoption fee is $175; he is neutered, microchipped, and up-to-date on all of his vaccines.

He&#39;s a great dog with a big heart and whose favorite things to do is cuddle and receive belly rubs. He can be playful too so a fenced yard would be a plus but is not required, with a couple quick walks each day he does just fine. Stu currently lives with two other dogs and is fine most of the time &quot;occasionally rude to male&quot; but he does not do well with cats. He is food reactive and would do best in a home with kids 13 yrs. or older. He has some separation anxiety but that has been easy managed with proper medication. Stu is very well socialized with people, is eager to please and is food motivated. He is smart and responds well to training. He knows sit, wait, release command (&ldquo;okay&rdquo;) and does well on a harness lead for walks. He is about 6.5 years old and crate and house trained.\n\nStu&rsquo;s adoption fee is $175; he is neutered, microchipped, and up-to-date on all of his vaccines.

We like to follow you wherever you go but we won't disturb your peace and quiet, as we promise we rarely ever bark. Not to mention, we don't mind being crated when you're away, or take us with you, we love going for car rides. We potty outside as long as we are taken outside frequently. We still enjoy going for short walks.\nOur top 3 favorite things in life are food, big cozy beds, and sunshine! We don't like the cold weather, snow, or rain! I must share with you, that we can't hear very well. We use to follow our (first)Foster Mom's hand signals instead of her voice. And I (Mango) had to have my right eye removed after I was rescued due to a bad infection. But it doesn't phase me. Mia doesn't like to be picked up but she always needs help to get up on the couch. We get along well with other doggies and kids who don't topple all over us. I'm not sure whether we like cats or not, we haven't had any kitty friends before. But we're so laid back, sweet, and affectionate. We're really easy pups to care for but we will need daily brushing and will need to see a groomer every month or every other month to keep us nice and handsome and pretty.  We can't wait to finally have a FOREVER family!!  www.dashanimalrescue.org Dashrescue00@gmail.com","isDogsOk":true,"energyLevel":"Moderate","isNeedingFoster":false,"isFound":false,"groomingNeeds":"High","priority":10,"isHousetrained":false,"isKidsOk":true,"name":"Mango & Mia (bonded pair)","pictureCount":25,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/8741\/pictures\/animals\/14970\/14970617\/71116975_100x133.jpg","rescueId":"D190504","searchString":"Mango & Mia (bonded pair)   Blue\/Silver\/Salt & Pepper  Medium D190504  Dogs Terrier \/ Norwich Terrier \/ Mixed (long coat)s","sizeCurrent":25,"sizeGroup":"Medium","sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-mango-mia-bonded-pair-terrier-dog","isSpecialNeeds":true,"specialNeedsDetails":"Both are hard of hearing or possibly deaf","isSponsorable":true,"url":"https:\/\/dashrescue.rescuegroups.org\/\/animals\/detail?AnimalID=14970617","videoCount":0,"videoUrlCount":0,"createdDate":"2019-10-17T18:33:33Z","updatedDate":"2021-06-30T14:40:24Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"71116975"},{"type":"pictures","id":"70556225"},{"type":"pictures","id":"70556226"},{"type":"pictures","id":"71132797"},{"type":"pictures","id":"71116362"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79039485"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79039486"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79039947"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79039484"},{"type":"pictures","id":"71116968"},{"type":"pictures","id":"71132795"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79039937"},{"type":"pictures","id":"70837636"},{"type":"pictures","id":"70556228"},{"type":"pictures","id":"69411040"},{"type":"pictures","id":"69410598"},{"type":"pictures","id":"69411039"},{"type":"pictures","id":"69410600"},{"type":"pictures","id":"69410613"},{"type":"pictures","id":"69410609"},{"type":"pictures","id":"69410622"},{"type":"pictures","id":"69223773"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79510789"},{"type":"pictures","id":"69410614"},{"type":"pictures","id":"69228262"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"8741"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"15162378","attributes":{"distance":11.84,"activityLevel":"Slightly Active","adoptionFeeString":"$125","isAdoptionPending":false,"adultSexesOk":"All","ageGroup":"Adult","ageString":"5 Years 11 Months","birthDate":"2015-07-23T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Boxer \/ Mastiff \/ Mixed (short coat)","breedPrimary":"Boxer","breedPrimaryId":104,"breedSecondary":"Mastiff","breedSecondaryId":167,"isBreedMixed":true,"isCatsOk":false,"coatLength":"Short","isCourtesyListing":false,"isCurrentVaccinations":true,"isDeclawed":false,"descriptionHtml":"Misty was found tied outside a shelter late one night.

application that requires the potential adopter to wait 24 hours until their application can be verified. Once everything checks out the adopter comes and picks up their new fur member of the family and signs a contract. One of the highlights of our contract states that if for ANY reason at ANY time they cannot care for the animal, they must return the cat or dog back to Colony Cats (& dogs). Our adoption fees are $75.- for kittens (6 months and younger), $65.- for cats, $45.- for Wise Whiskers (7 years and older). We often have adoption specials where the adoption fees are lowered. The adoption fee includes the animals already being spayed\/neutered, Feline Leukemia tested (cats), Heartworm tested (cats and dogs), all vaccinations (FVRCP and DHLPP), rabies vaccine (if kittens or puppies adopted are not old enough to have received a rabies vaccine, then the new owner can bring them back for that at no extra cost), microchip, flea\/tick\/heartworm preventative.","about":"We are a 501c3, non-profit, all volunteer animal rescue and welfare organization. We are dedicated to ending the explosion of homeless pets in this area; through low cost (sometimes no cost) spay\/neuter, public education\/awareness, rescue\/adoption and support for feral\/stray cats and their caregivers. We do this because there is an epidemic of abused, neglected, abandoned animals throughout Central Ohio. As a compassionate organization we are striving to end this suffering for them.
