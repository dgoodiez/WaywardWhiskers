He most likely will thrive&nbsp;in a home with no young children under the age of 10 years old&nbsp;and with a dog that is of calmer temperament. His forever pawrents must also be comfortable with his growls because he is a&nbsp;talkative dog - albeit all&nbsp;bark and no bite. He just likes to &quot;trash talk&quot; He favors men and possibly&nbsp;older women.

We allow our dogs time to settle in with their foster families so that we can evaluate their health and personality.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;Ginger is 4 yrs old and&nbsp;a beautiful, friendly collie who is a Velcro dog around her people both inside and out, always making sure she knows where her family is.&nbsp; She is eager to please and affectionate and when praised and petted she wiggles her whole body to let you know how much she&rsquo;s enjoying it.&nbsp; She is happiest when she is as close to you as she can get- at your feet, next to you or even on your lap!&nbsp; Ginger understands the commands Sit, Come, Shake, and knows her name.&nbsp; Outside running in a fenced in yard is a joy for her.&nbsp; She is easy going while being brushed and when riding in the car and is quiet. She is frightened by unfamiliar and loud noises and might bolt so keeping her inside during fireworks or thunderstorms will keep her safe.&nbsp; Steps were new to her and this smart girl quickly learned to go up and down them at her foster home.&nbsp; She is crate trained, does cry a bit at bedtime only because she wants to be where the family is, then quickly settles down for the night.&nbsp;&nbsp; She loves her toys but is possessive of them so needs a home where she can be the only dog and with children who are older and dog savvy.&nbsp; Her favorite thing in the world is to be with the people she loves and this sweet girl is looking for her forever family to love with all of her heart..The adoption fee for Ginger is $300.00.","isDogsOk":false,"isNeedingFoster":false,"isFound":false,"priority":10,"isHousetrained":true,"isKidsOk":true,"name":"Ginger","newPeopleReaction":"Cautious","obedienceTraining":"Has Basic Training","pictureCount":3,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1191\/pictures\/animals\/16921\/16921252\/79635930_100x100.jpg","qualities":["affectionate","cratetrained","eagerToPlease","gentle","doesWellInCar","intelligent","leashtrained","obedient","olderKidsOnly","playsToys","timid"],"rescueId":"Almost Home","searchString":"Ginger   Sable Female Large Almost Home  Dogs Collie (medium coat)s","sex":"Female","sizeCurrent":55,"sizeGroup":"Large","sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-ginger-collie-dog","isSponsorable":false,"videoCount":0,"videoUrlCount":0,"createdDate":"2021-06-21T16:11:17Z","updatedDate":"2021-08-05T02:50:06Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"79635930"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79635931"},{"type":"pictures","id":"79959191"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"1191"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"124"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"8"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"16931801","attributes":{"distance":17.09,"activityLevel":"Highly Active","adoptionFeeString":"$275","isAdoptionPending":false,"ageGroup":"Adult","ageString":"2 Years","birthDate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Rat Terrier \/ Mixed (short coat)","breedPrimary":"Rat Terrier","breedPrimaryId":186,"isBreedMixed":true,"coatLength":"Short","isCourtesyListing":false,"isCurrentVaccinations":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p>LuLu is a very sweet girl but is still a little timid.

One of the highlights of our contract states that if for ANY reason at ANY time they cannot care for the animal, they must return the cat or dog back to Colony Cats (& dogs). Our adoption fees are $75.- for kittens (6 months and younger), $65.- for cats, $45.- for Wise Whiskers (7 years and older). We often have adoption specials where the adoption fees are lowered. The adoption fee includes the animals already being spayed\/neutered, Feline Leukemia tested (cats), Heartworm tested (cats and dogs), all vaccinations (FVRCP and DHLPP), rabies vaccine (if kittens or puppies adopted are not old enough to have received a rabies vaccine, then the new owner can bring them back for that at no extra cost), microchip, flea\/tick\/heartworm preventative.","about":"We are a 501c3, non-profit, all volunteer animal rescue and welfare organization.

We do this because there is an epidemic of abused, neglected, abandoned animals throughout Central Ohio. As a compassionate organization we are striving to end this suffering for them.
