The wooly coat requires much more grooming so she will need a home that understands that and gets her to the groomer. She is somewhat tolerant of brushing for short periods but if you try too long, she will snap at you. She is a happy, bouncy girl but can be the laziest sun bather and napper. She is cute as a button and will follow her people around but she does have a snappy side to her as well. She is startled by quick approaches and does not like to be led by her collar. You can leash her up just fine but she is untrusting if you try to lead her anywhere by her collar. She will put the brakes on and try to get away from you. Shortly after she came to us, she started having seizures. Her bloodwork is fine but her seizures lasted 4 plus minutes so she is now on phenobarb. She has not had another seizure since she has been on meds.\n\n\nEnergy Level: Low to Medium\n\n\nGood with Dogs: Yes but only engages with a handful of dogs in her foster home.\n\nGood with Children: Nellie can be a bit snappy sometimes so she will be best in a home with children 13 or older. She sometimes is freaked out by fast movements and might be anxious with young children and their exuberance. \n\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens,&nbsp;birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we don&#39;t have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.&nbsp;\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours&nbsp;that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes.&nbsp;You need to fill out&nbsp;our adoption application (http:\/\/www.southernsiberian.com\/info\/adoption)&nbsp;and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all&nbsp;have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you.

Polysfund.org stepped in and offered medical and transport to get her to safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nPERSONALITY: Azulia is an absolute sweetheart. She loves having people around her but can be a bit weary of men (she may have been abused in Mexico). She&#39;s a character and a talker :)\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAINING: Azulia has no training and could use some basic obedience training as she tends to jump on people. She is actually fairly good on leash (other than the jumping)... and she may need work on housebreaking as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nWOULD DO BEST: Azulia would do well in a home with someone who is familiar with her breed mix. She absolutely requires a yard with 6 foot or higher fencing.\n\n\n\n\n\nCATS\/DOGS\/KIDS: Azulia could live with one other&nbsp;big, calm male dog with a proper introduction but is definitely not recommended for homes with female dogs, cats or tiny dogs. She was with children as young as 5 in her foster home in Mexico and did great with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nVET RECORD: All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed\/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\nAVAILABILITY:&nbsp;This dog is available for adoption now and is being fostered or kenneled in the San Fernando Valley area. Please email us and we will send you an adoption application. Local adoptions only (we do not ship dogs).\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit our website: http:\/\/www.foreverhomepetrescue.org\/\n\n","energyLevel":"Moderate","exerciseNeeds":"Moderate","isNeedingFoster":false,"isFound":false,"priority":10,"isHousetrained":false,"isKidsOk":true,"name":"Azulia","newPeopleReaction":"Friendly","pictureCount":5,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/1895\/pictures\/animals\/10442\/10442930\/72383761_100x121.jpg","sex":"Female","sizeGroup":"X-Large","sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-azulia-akita-dog","isSpecialNeeds":false,"isSponsorable":false,"videoCount":0,"videoUrlCount":0,"isYardRequired":true,"createdDate":"2016-08-14T20:11:17Z","updatedDate":"2020-05-06T19:51:39Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"72383761"},{"type":"pictures","id":"40460241"},{"type":"pictures","id":"38013239"},{"type":"pictures","id":"38013240"},{"type":"pictures","id":"38013241"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"1895"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"78"},{"type":"breeds","id":"152"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"8"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"10445583","attributes":{"activityLevel":"Highly Active","isAdoptionPending":false,"adultSexesOk":"All","ageGroup":"Adult","ageString":"7 Years","birthDate":"2014-08-10T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Labrador Retriever \/ Mixed (medium coat)","breedPrimary":"Labrador Retriever","breedPrimaryId":162,"isBreedMixed":true,"isCatsOk":false,"coatLength":"Medium","isCourtesyListing":false,"isDeclawed":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p>Bosco is available through our Homebuddies program \n<span style=\"display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">.

font-size: 10pt;\">We don&rsquo;t know a lot about Dillon's early life other than a Good Samaritan took him in to keep him safe after he appeared to have been abandoned on a rural road.&nbsp; His Good Sam said he sat in one spot on the road for several days and appeared to be waiting for his &lsquo;ride&rsquo; to come back to get him.&nbsp; After about 4 days, he gave up and went looking for food and water, which he found in her garage!<br \/><br \/>We do know that Dillon has some social anxiety issues and he can go from happy to distraught and nippy in situations with multiple people moving around in an area.&nbsp; He has always done fine in his original foster home, but had a few 'incidents' in an adopting home, and he was returned to AAMR.&nbsp; It is sad because Dillon is a very sweet and loving little guy ... until his anxiety takes over.&nbsp; 'Stranger Danger' is very real to him and in his mind, he needs to protect himself.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">We are not really sure of Dillon&rsquo;s breed mix.&nbsp; He has a dachshund-like body (long and low)&nbsp;with the head of a tiny yellow lab!&nbsp; Dillon really&nbsp;deserves a family who wants to help him develop some confidence and some manners so he can be the lucky dog he is meant to be.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp; He is very excitable and vocal when left alone for too long&nbsp;and will not be the best apartment resident.&nbsp; <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Dillon's wish list includes 1) a fenced yard, 2) an&nbsp;low-key, settled family willing to spend time with him and accept his limitations and 3) people to cuddle with every day who will&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">teach him how to be the best boy ever<\/span>.&nbsp; Could that be you?<br \/><br \/>Dillon does well with most other dogs, so having another confident, friendly dog in the home may be good for him.&nbsp; Absolutely no children in the home.&nbsp; If there are children visiting the home, it will be best to give Dillon a safe, out-of-the-way area to rest in his crate while the children are around.&nbsp; They make him very anxious.<br \/><br \/>Please read the rest of Dillon's bio below so you can learn more about him.<br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;

Graham is well mannered and laid back but can have his playful moments. He&#39;s an old, slow boy who just needs love and attention :)\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAINING: Graham has no basic commands as far as training - but he does not pull on leash and is a dream to walk. He may need some work on housebreaking.\n\n\n\n\n\nWOULD DO BEST: Graham would do best in a laid back home, where he has a yard and not too many stairs for his old bones. He just needs a couple of good napping spots.\n\n\n\n\n\nCATS\/DOGS\/KIDS: Graham seems to do okay with large breed dogs but would require a proper introduction to other dogs. He is not recommended for children under 10 years old.

She was also featured on the cover of one of Georgia&#39;s largest circulation magazines in an article on Cat Cafe&#39;s.&nbsp; She is truly one of our favorites and can&#39;t wait for her to find her right furrrrever home!!!\n\nIf you&#39;d like to meet one of our kitties&nbsp;go to&nbsp;www.catrangers.org&nbsp;and submit an&nbsp;application form or go to&nbsp;https:\/\/www.catrangers.org\/forms\/form?formid=6170","energyLevel":"Moderate","exerciseNeeds":"Low","fenceNeeds":"Not Required","isFound":false,"groomingNeeds":"Low","priority":10,"isHousetrained":true,"indoorOutdoor":"Indoor Only","isKidsOk":false,"name":"Buffy","newPeopleReaction":"Friendly","ownerExperience":"None","pictureCount":6,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5211\/pictures\/animals\/10832\/10832983\/77757245_100x66.jpg","qualities":["affectionate","eagerToPlease","gentle","olderKidsOnly","playful"],"searchString":"Buffy   Cream (Mostly) Female Medium   Cats Tabby \/ Domestic Short Hair \/ Mixed (short coat)s","sex":"Female","sheddingLevel":"Moderate","sizeGroup":"Medium","sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-buffy-tabby-cat","isSpecialNeeds":false,"isSponsorable":true,"sponsorshipDetails":"One month of food, supplies and loving care","sponsorshipMinimum":"20.00","summary":"Beautiful Buff Girl with Orange Eyes","url":"https:\/\/CatRangers.rescuegroups.org\/animals\/detail?AnimalID=10832983","videoCount":0,"videoUrlCount":0,"vocalLevel":"Some","isYardRequired":false,"createdDate":"2016-11-28T18:59:32Z","updatedDate":"2021-06-22T22:39:26Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"77757245"},{"type":"pictures","id":"76960561"},{"type":"pictures","id":"74178763"},{"type":"pictures","id":"74178765"},{"type":"pictures","id":"74178767"},{"type":"pictures","id":"64005221"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"5211"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"63"},{"type":"breeds","id":"35"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"3"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"10854828","attributes":{"activityLevel":"Moderately Active","isAdoptionPending":false,"adultSexesOk":"All","ageGroup":"Young","ageString":"6 Years 3 Months","birthDate":"2015-04-12T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Dilute Calico \/ Domestic Short Hair \/ Mixed (short coat)","breedPrimary":"Dilute Calico","breedPrimaryId":426,"breedSecondary":"Domestic Short Hair","breedSecondaryId":35,"isBreedMixed":true,"isCatsOk":true,"coatLength":"Short","colorDetails":"lovely grey, peach and white dilute calico","isCourtesyListing":false,"isCurrentVaccinations":true,"isDeclawed":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\">\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;\">Hi, I&#39;m Tabitha.

She came from the Ross County Humane Society in Ohio, and as she settled in we saw how fearful April was and that she would need a lot of confidence-building in order to make her more comfortable in both a home and the outside world. Despite that, we were able to get April adopted within the month, with her family immediately beginning training with us we thought April landed in the right home. After a few months, the family contacted us and decided April was not the right fit for them. During her first couple of weeks back with us, we noticed some behavioral changes in April, including a more reserved and uneasy nature when it came to meeting strangers. Our main goal was to build her trust and confidence around people and once over that hurdle, we realized how desperately this gorgeous girl wanted to please her people.<\/span>\n<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Nexa Regular&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Nexa Regular&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Nexa Regular&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Coming back into our shelter was not the ideal environment for April&rsquo;s health, so we knew right away that we had to get her a friend. We matched her with Sora and now the best part of April&rsquo;s day is getting out in the yard with her best friend. This confidence boost of being around another dog led April to be placed in foster with one of our staff members. In that home, she was with three other dogs and we were able to really understand her hesitation with people. As her fosters gained her trust, April built more confidence knowing that they would not hurt her.<\/span>\n<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Nexa Regular&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Nexa Regular&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Nexa Regular&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">For April&rsquo;s adoption, her new family would have to meet her several times and come to learn the excellent training she has learned here at Adopt-A-Dog.

He likes sunbathing for a little bit outside but doesn&rsquo;t want to be left outdoors all the time; Max wants and needs to be an indoor dog so he can feel wanted and loved, but he still needs a backyard for play time and sunbathing. He NEEDS a new home without CHILDREN or MEN, they make him very nervous and doesn&#39;t like them; It could be because he was raised by a woman only and his foster home only has a woman in the house. He really is a lover and would love to go home with you. He promises to be devoted to you and love you more than you can love him back.\n\nSECURE FENCING REQUIRED FOR ALL OF OUR RESCUED DOGS.\n\nFor more information call (925) 473-4642.\n\nIf you are considering adopting a dog through HALO Here are some helpful hints:\n\nPlease bring pictures of your backyard showing your fencing and yard and&nbsp;BRING any other dogs that you have to be introduced to make sure that they get along. Most of our dogs require a 6 foot fenced yard. Yards must be cleared of any fox tail weeds. The adoption donation is cash or check.\n\nWe do adopt small dogs to apartments or condo and need to see pictures of the backyard. If you rent, please bring copy of your lease to show you can have pets and any size restrictions.\n\nWe do not adopt to homes with children under the age of five unless we know the history of the dog with young children. All Children MUST be present at adoption. Max does not want children or men in his new home.","isDogsOk":true,"energyLevel":"Moderate","exerciseNeeds":"Moderate","fenceNeeds":"6 foot","isNeedingFoster":true,"isFound":false,"groomingNeeds":"Low","priority":10,"isHousetrained":true,"indoorOutdoor":"Indoor Only","isKidsOk":false,"name":"Max","newPeopleReaction":"Protective","obedienceTraining":"Well Trained","ownerExperience":"None","pictureCount":4,"pictureThumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5502\/pictures\/animals\/11060\/11060673\/74283736_100x118.jpg","qualities":["affectionate","cratetrained","eagerToPlease","eventempered","fetches","gentle","doesWellInCar","intelligent","lap","leashtrained","noLargeDogs","obedient","oKForSeniors","playful","playsToys","protective","timid"],"rescueId":"HD5915","sex":"Male","sheddingLevel":"Moderate","sizeCurrent":17,"sizeGroup":"Small","sizeUOM":"Pounds","slug":"adopt-max-terrier-dog","isSpecialNeeds":false,"isSponsorable":false,"videoCount":3,"videoUrlCount":1,"vocalLevel":"Some","isYardRequired":true,"createdDate":"2017-02-07T19:27:00Z","updatedDate":"2021-04-30T16:30:17Z"},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"type":"pictures","id":"74283736"},{"type":"pictures","id":"74283737"},{"type":"pictures","id":"74283738"},{"type":"pictures","id":"54563707"}]},"orgs":{"data":[{"type":"orgs","id":"5502"}]},"breeds":{"data":[{"type":"breeds","id":"208"},{"type":"breeds","id":"118"}]},"species":{"data":[{"type":"species","id":"8"}]}}},{"type":"animals","id":"11065341","attributes":{"activityLevel":"Highly Active","isAdoptionPending":false,"adultSexesOk":"All","ageGroup":"Adult","ageString":"7 Years 1 Month","birthDate":"2014-02-09T00:00:00Z","isBirthDateExact":false,"breedString":"Pit Bull Terrier \/ Boston Terrier \/ Mixed (short coat)","breedPrimary":"Pit Bull Terrier","breedPrimaryId":179,"breedSecondary":"Boston Terrier","breedSecondaryId":102,"isBreedMixed":true,"coatLength":"Short","isCourtesyListing":false,"isCurrentVaccinations":true,"isDeclawed":false,"descriptionHtml":"<p>Bailey once had a family and she adored them.

All of which is included for the adoption donation of $125. He was born on the Ides of March, 2012 in Beacon, NY and closes the loop as the last generation coming from his colony. His special needs consist of simply keeping a steady environment and schedule, and offering him your love and attention. His interesting face is so unique that he captures the attention of anyone looking at him. Have you ever seen such eyes? He is truly special. He is vetted, and waiting for his forever family to meet him and fall in love.

All of which is included for the adoption donation of $125. He was born on the Ides of March, 2012 in Beacon, NY and closes the loop as the last generation coming from his colony. His special needs consist of simply keeping a steady environment and schedule, and offering him your love and attention. His interesting face is so unique that he captures the attention of anyone looking at him. Have you ever seen such eyes? He is truly special. He is vetted, and waiting for his forever family to meet him and fall in love. If you&#39;d like to meet Eddye, please complete our application and we will contact you for an appointment. We work in our homes, therefor require a completed application before we give you our address for a visit.&nbsp;\n\n\nOur required adoption donation is $150 per kitten or $125 per cat (older than 9 months). All our rescues are up to date on shots, microchipped, tested for FIV\/FeL. They are dewormed, treated for parasites and free of fleas. Each is spayed or neutered and given a rabies vaccination. An&nbsp;application&nbsp;must be completed to be considered to adopt from Stray HELP. You can download it from here:&nbsp; https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0BywbjguyJTiLb2tfV1ROOEdZMVE\/view\n\n\n\nIf your application is approved we conduct a home visit for final approval of adoption.

Chipper is a super smart and happy boy.&nbsp; He is medium energy, loves a good zoomie in the yard and loves a good couch snuggle fest.&nbsp; Chipper went into a foster home back in April 2017 when he first came into our rescue from the shelter.&nbsp; His foster mom ended up adopting him on 3\/30\/2018 after falling in love with this boy.&nbsp; He has a doggie sister named Snow who is a white pitbull and his best friend.&nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately, Chipper&#39;s&nbsp;mom&#39;s home life has had some changes which includes a new home in the country with a boyfriend and 2 young children on a part-time basis.&nbsp; Not being used to young kids, Chipper is nervous and snappy around the children so he has to wear a basket muzzle for safety when the children are around.&nbsp; At his old home he had a 6 foot privacy fenced yard with an electric fence to ensure he did not get out.&nbsp; However, his new home is&nbsp;on a large amount of land that is unfenced and when Chipper gets a whiff of the horses or goats nearby he tends to take off and roam which is not safe for him to do in the country.&nbsp; The safety of Chipper and the children is the biggest priority and we are seeking a new home for Chipper where he will be happier and kept safe&nbsp;while outside playing\/pottying.&nbsp; Chipper listens well and would do best with an adult(s) that are alpha owners.&nbsp; Although he gets along well with Snow (his doggie sister) he probably would do best as an only dog.&nbsp; Another dog is a possibility with slow introductions but it may take work.&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not do well with cats or children under 16.&nbsp; He walks OK on a leash but hasn&#39;t been regularly walked in a while.&nbsp; He is housebroken, crate-trained and loves riding in the car.&nbsp; He leads a pretty spoiled life right now filled with puppacino&#39;s, kiddie pools, bed snuggling and lots of attention.&nbsp; However, his current mom wants him to live a long happy unrestricted life and wants what is best for him.&nbsp; We are all hoping that someone out there can give this boy a chance to find the perfect family that can work with his quirks.&nbsp; He has a lot of love to give and is just the sweetest boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Chipper or meeting him please call, text or email Holly at (678) 939-6981 or holly@friendstotheforlorn.org.&nbsp;

Every home and every companion animal has it 's own unique personality and requirements. We place our animals in the supportive and loving environment of home foster care. While there, we gain knowledge about their personality, training skills, likes and dislikes.\n\nTo assist us with matching the correct companion animal with the most appropriate and compatible home,please email us the answers to the below questions and any other information you think would be helpful. The emailed information may be followed-up by a Camp Papillon Adoption Coordinator, with a phone interview and then a home check.\n\nAdoption contract and post adoption follow-up checks are required as a condition of adoption. Some companion animals get multiple applicants or are not appropriate matches, so not all adoptions will be approved. Not all applicants will receive a yes or no response due to limited staff. We reserve the right to refuse any adoption without justification. \n\n\nOur Adoption Costs\nDogs: $250\nPuppies:$300\nPuppies $50 Refund after proof of spay\/neuter\nCats: $75\nKittens: $100\nKittens $25 Refund after proof of spay \/ neuter\nRabbits, Ferrets, etc: $25\n\nWhy the high cost? Can't I adopt an animal for less? No.. and here's why: Our animals come fully vetted. It costs us less for medical care then you due to non-profit discount. So if you adopt an animal for less it will cost you more later. Spay & Neutering your animals, along with keeping up on shots prevents disease & illnesses.\n","about":"Camp Papillon is a non-profit, no-kill 501c3 animal rescue group dedicated to giving all homeless animals a place to call home. All of our animals are currently housed in foster homes, we don't have an actual location for housing the animals we rescue. These foster families are made up of dedicated volunteers who open their homes to dogs, cats, rabbits and other animals that are in need of a place to live until they can be adopted.\n\nThis allows the fosters to evaluate the animals and determine how they interact with people, other dogs, cats, etc. so we can place them in their forever homes. In some cases, the animals are ready for adoption upon entering our rescue. Others need some training or have behavioral issues that need to be addressed before we put them up for adoption. Many shelters would have euthanized dogs that they deem unadoptable, but not us. The foster situation is the best way to be sure these animals are well socialized with people and, most times, with other animals. Camp Papillon covers ALL the costs associated with fostering our animals from vet care to food, toys, treats, etc. Our fosters just supply the love and affection to the animals they take in.\n","services":"adoptions,rescue,shelter,pet food","type":"Shelter","lat":40.95869827270508,"lon":-75.29920196533203,"coordinates":"40.9587, -75.2992","citystate":"Stroudsburg, PA"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"185","attributes":{"name":"Pug"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/185"}},{"type":"species","id":"8","attributes":{"singular":"Dog","plural":"Dogs","youngSingular":"Puppy","youngPlural":"Puppies"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/species\/8"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"77762729","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":47895,"resolutionX":640,"resolutionY":480,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5152\/pictures\/animals\/9835\/9835234\/77762729_640x480.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":13471,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":375,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5152\/pictures\/animals\/9835\/9835234\/77762729_500x375.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":1888,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":75,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5152\/pictures\/animals\/9835\/9835234\/77762729_100x75.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2021-04-05T00:06:50Z","updated":"2021-04-05T00:06:50Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"33950508","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":48828,"resolutionX":400,"resolutionY":600,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5152\/pictures\/animals\/9835\/9835234\/33950508_400x600.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":48828,"resolutionX":400,"resolutionY":600,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5152\/pictures\/animals\/9835\/9835234\/33950508_400x600.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2847,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":150,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5152\/pictures\/animals\/9835\/9835234\/33950508_100x150.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2016-04-16T19:19:49Z","updated":"2021-04-05T00:06:50Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"33655170","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":1123835,"resolutionX":1494,"resolutionY":2656,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5152\/pictures\/animals\/9835\/9835234\/33655170_1494x2656.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":85265,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":888,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5152\/pictures\/animals\/9835\/9835234\/33655170_500x888.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":7024,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":177,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5152\/pictures\/animals\/9835\/9835234\/33655170_100x177.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2016-04-04T00:04:20Z","updated":"2021-04-05T00:06:50Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"5152","attributes":{"name":"Misfits, Mutts and Meows, Inc.","street":"PO Box 84","city":"Crescent","state":"ok","postalcode":"73028","country":"United States","phone":"(405) 471-3922","email":"misfitsmuttsmeows@hotmail.com","url":"http:\/\/www.petfinder.com\/shelters\/OK305.html","facebookUrl":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Misfits-Mutts-Meows\/204580829553079","adoptionProcess":"adoption application process plus adoption contract.

According to Texas law the fee is not a donation.  \nAll adopters must have spayed or neutered any current animals, provide vet information so shot history can be verified.

Home check (either done after you meet the dog or concurrently).\n\n3. Adoption Contract\n\n4. Adoption fee (fees are listed on each pet's profile)\n\nAll dogs will be microchipped, dewormed, vaccinated (on schedule) and spayed\/neutered before adoption. Please be prepared to allow your new pet a few weeks to become used to his\/her new surroundings and life. All dogs are different and it can take different amounts of time for them to acclimate into their new environment. Be patient and you will be rewarded with a lifetime of love from your new best friend.","about":"Recycled Pets NorCal is a 501(c)3 non-profit rescue dedicated to homeless pets. We provide forever homes in the Sacramento, California area for animals in need working with shelters and rescues throughout California.

Dogs Rock is a not for profit animal rescue founded in 2015. We exist solely on donations and will rely primarily on fundraising to help animals in need.\n\nOur mission is to raise awareness of the ever growing plight of homeless animals in this country, both in shelters and those dumped on our streets. Way too many amazing animals are euthanized every single day simply because they are homeless.\n\nWe want to introduce these animals to the public and educate people that unwanted companion animals are not damaged goods or unworthy, but really can be great family pets. Because the abuse, neglect, cruelty and medical cases cost shelters the most money and are the most urgent, they are often the first animals euthanized.\n\nIt is our goal to focus on the rescue of these urgent animals and provide them immediately the routine, emergency or specialized medical care they need and deserve. We will go beyond just vet care and get these animals rehabilitated as needed using trainers and behaviorists to help overcome issues related to past trauma.\n\nIt is our belief that no injured or abused animal should lose its life simply due to lack of funds. We do not have our own shelter, and we will rely on volunteers, fosters and adopters to take the animals into their homes and provide them with proper care and nurturing.\n\nAll of our animals will be vaccinated, heartworm tested, micro-chipped and altered. All of our homes, foster or adopter, will be fully screened, including references and vet check, an interview with the applicant and a home visit to ensure the home is the right fit for the animal.\n\nOur outreach and education efforts will take place online via Facebook, web site and other social media as well as in person in the community via community events, school assemblies and any place people may lawfully gather to exchange information and learn.\n\nOur message is one teaching general animal care and welfare, population control through spay and neuter and disease control in the animal population via proper vaccinations.\n\n ","services":"adoptions","type":"Rescue","lat":40.776100158691406,"lon":-73.95259857177734,"coordinates":"40.7761, -73.9526","citystate":"New York, NY"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"108","attributes":{"name":"Bull Terrier"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/108"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"729","attributes":{"name":"American Pit Bull Terrier"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/729"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"34355402","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":78616,"resolutionX":400,"resolutionY":400,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/6329\/pictures\/animals\/9950\/9950420\/34355402_400x400.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":78616,"resolutionX":400,"resolutionY":400,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/6329\/pictures\/animals\/9950\/9950420\/34355402_400x400.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3539,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":100,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/6329\/pictures\/animals\/9950\/9950420\/34355402_100x100.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2016-05-04T18:25:15Z","updated":"2016-05-04T18:25:15Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"34355403","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":82051,"resolutionX":400,"resolutionY":400,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/6329\/pictures\/animals\/9950\/9950420\/34355403_400x400.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":82051,"resolutionX":400,"resolutionY":400,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/6329\/pictures\/animals\/9950\/9950420\/34355403_400x400.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3167,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":100,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/6329\/pictures\/animals\/9950\/9950420\/34355403_100x100.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2016-05-04T18:25:15Z","updated":"2016-05-04T18:25:15Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"34355404","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":74258,"resolutionX":400,"resolutionY":400,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/6329\/pictures\/animals\/9950\/9950420\/34355404_400x400.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":74258,"resolutionX":400,"resolutionY":400,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/6329\/pictures\/animals\/9950\/9950420\/34355404_400x400.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3341,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":100,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/6329\/pictures\/animals\/9950\/9950420\/34355404_100x100.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2016-05-04T18:25:15Z","updated":"2016-05-04T18:25:15Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"6329","attributes":{"name":"Animal House Shelter, Inc.","street":"13005 Ernesti Road ","city":"Huntley","state":"IL","postalcode":"60142","country":"United States","phone":"(847) 961-5541","email":"info@animalhouseshelter.com","url":"http:\/\/www.animalhouseshelter.com","facebookUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AnimalHouseShelter?ref=hl","adoptionUrl":"https:\/\/www.animalhouseshelter.com\/adoption-application\/","donationUrl":"https:\/\/ahshelter.ejoinme.org\/MyPages\/DonationPage\/tabid\/260948\/Default.aspx","sponsorshipUrl":"https:\/\/ahshelter.ejoinme.org\/MyPages\/DonationPage\/tabid\/260948\/Default.aspx","adoptionProcess":"Animal House Shelter tries to keep the environment for the animals in our care, as healthy, stress free and comfortable as possible during their stay with us.

Once rehabilitated and ready, they are carefully matched with prospective adopters and placed in loving homes. Over 23,000 pets have been adopted from Animal House Shelter.\n\nLike people, animals have distinct personalities that make them unique. At Animal House Shelter, we are proud to say that the dogs and cats are treated like our own. We care enough to be certain they are treated with the comfort and respect that they deserve and we make every effort to ensure that they go to the right, forever, permanent, loving home.\n\nThe best possible veterinary care is always given to Animal House Shelter pets and treatment is never declined if it will give the animal a chance for a healthy life. Socializing and keeping our pets happy is also of utmost importance. Dogs are walked 4-5 times daily and cats are housed in a large, whimsical, free-roam habitat All are given loving care and attention by staff and volunteers.\n\n All dogs and cats are given all vaccinations- including their Rabies vaccine if old enough. They are neutered,  microchipped,  dewormed and heartworm tested (Dogs)  or FeLV\/FIV tested (Cats). Dogs are kept on heartworm preventative & all animals receive Frontline Plus monthly by Animal House.\n\nAnimal House takes in many special needs animals.  We take care of any ailment or surgery that needs to be done on any animal we rescue including, but not limited to: heart worm treatments, cruciate ligament repair, patella surgery, FHO, heart surgery, diabetes, anxiety disorders, auto immune deficiencies, liver shunts etc.  On average, AHS takes in at least one animal per week that has one of the above ailments or needs surgery.  We do not believe that any animal should be left to be euthanized at a high kill facility because they are sick or injured.  Society has already failed them at one point in time and someone needs to speak up and rescue those that are defenseless and without a voice.  That is who we are are and that is what Animal House Shelter has always been about.

","about":"Rescue Ridge is a highly recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit, no-kill animal rescue organization in Monmouth County, that has been steadily saving lives for over ten years.  Formed by the efforts of a local woman in 2001, Terri Willis committed her life to helping the animals of our community.  Born with a severe heart defect, Terri never allowed her disability to slow her down.  Her endless love, determination and dedication to all the animals was heartwarming and remarkable.  When she passed away, the animal community lost a great advocate and rescuer.  Although no longer with us, Terri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undying spirit continues on through her dream\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. The dream of Rescue Ridge.\n\nStaffed entirely by volunteers, Rescue Ridge relies exclusively on donations, sponsorships and fundraisers for support, which goes back to the animals.  With the help of our many followers and volunteers, we primarily serve the Monmouth and Ocean Counties of the Jersey Shore, but have gone much further to rescue animals in need.  Known in our area as the \u00e2\u0080\u009clast chance\u00e2\u0080\u009d rescue, we have taken in many animals slated for euthanasia by shelters.  Animals come to us from all over the communities we serve for many different reasons.  We have helped animals whose owners could no longer care for them due to age, illness, behavioral or economic reasons, keeping them out of the overcrowded shelters and adopting them back into loving homes.  We have never turned away a stray or any animal in distress.  We have taken in \u00e2\u0080\u009cdifficult\u00e2\u0080\u009d dogs that most other rescues or shelters would not even consider.  We take the time to socialize them, work with them and ultimately make them adoptable.\n\nOur vision is to take our efforts to a new level.  Committed to saving the lives of our community pets, Rescue Ridge is dedicated to the goal of introducing a no-kill shelter to Monmouth County.  Beyond a shelter, this safe haven for animals will offer our community the help it needs to finally put an end to the senseless deaths and unnecessary loss of life that these animals face daily.  Our focus will include education and affordable medical care to pet owners, keeping their animals healthy, comfortable and in their homes where they belong.  Never should a family have to surrender their pet to a shelter because they cannot afford their medical treatment.  We will also extend microchipping to our fellow animal lovers, making sure lost pets find their way home and not behind the bars of a shelter, where they can quickly wear out their welcome waiting for their family to find them.  We would be a proactive leader in putting an end to animal overpopulation by offering a true low cost spay\/neuter clinic.  A TNR (Trap & Release) Program would also be offered for feral cats, which would help keep the cat overpopulation to a minimum.  Our adoption center would be a safe and happy place, where families can come meet their new best friend.  Beyond all of this, we will offer affordable training and animal socialization to our communities, which will in turn, reinforce public safety and ensure the safety of our beloved pets.  This safe haven will be run by staff and our dedicated, experienced volunteers, many of whom have been with us for over ten years.\nBeing tremendous animal lovers, we all share the same belief that we can and we will make a difference, one animal at a time.  We know that this is not an easy task ahead, but there are many people and groups that will whole-heartedly support our efforts in making this happen.  And we are proud to have their encouragement.  \n\n","services":"adoptions, fostering","type":"Rescue","lat":40.15359878540039,"lon":-74.03829956054688,"coordinates":"40.1536,

We have been solely foster based since 2010 and are currently building our new facility.   We do it all with volunteers and we do it because we love it!  The animals deserve better and we try our best to offer them that by doing what we can, when we can, the best we can, with what we have and with all our heart.

489-5889","email":"allbreedvt@allbreedrescuevt.com","url":"http:\/\/www.allbreedrescuevt.com\/","facebookUrl":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/allbreedrescuevt","adoptionProcess":"All Breed Rescue is a compassionate non-profit rescue organization dedicated to saving the lives of dogs in Vermont and from high-kill shelters in the South. We take special care to match the right home with the right dog, ensuring a lifetime of love for both the pet and the adopter. To ensure the best matches are made, we have a process that has been proven effective in determining the best homes for our animals. We strive to find the best homes possible for our dogs, as well as find the right dog for you and your lifestyle.\nStep 1 \u0096 Complete Adoption Application The first step in the adoption process is filling out the application on our website. This application will tell us about you and your lifestyle, your home environment and your experience with pet ownership. We cannot accommodate an introduction with one of our dogs without this first step being completed.\nStep 2 \u0096 Application Preliminary Review Our application review volunteers will initially screen your application to determine if all necessary information was provided. If not you will be contacted to either fill out another application or provide additional information. Please allow 24 \u0096 48 hours for a volunteer to get back to you. After submitting your application, be sure to add allbreedvt@gmail.com to your contacts or check your spam folder. Most of our communication is done via e-mail.\nStep 3 \u0096 Landlord Approval Verified If it is determined that you rent your home, your landlord will be contacted to make sure you have approval to have a dog in your home. We also ask about any breed or size limitations. If your landlord does not allow for a dog in your home, your application will be denied at this point in the process.\nStep 4 \u0096 Veterinary References Contacted Our volunteers will contact the veterinary reference(s) you provided to determine if all your current pets are spayed\/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. If you don\u0092t have any current pets, we will ask about the veterinary care that your previous pets received. If you have never owned a pet, this step is skipped. We are happy to make recommendations if you are looking for a veterinarian. If your veterinary reference(s) cannot verify the spay\/neuter and vaccination status of current or previous pets, processing of your application will be held until you can provide this information.\nStep 5 \u0096 Personal References Contacted Our volunteers will contact your personal references and ask them questions in regards to whether they consider you to be a responsible pet owner. This is the portion of the process that can take the most amount of time. It is helpful if you contact your references and ask them to return our calls in a timely manner. If our reference checking volunteers have any major concerns about adopting a dog to you, based on communication with your references, your application may be denied at this point in the process.\nStep 6 \u0096 Meeting between Approved Applicant & Available Dogs. Most of our dogs are currently boarding at a facility in South Burlington, however our organization is volunteer run. We do NOT arrange meetings between interested individuals and our dogs until an applicant has been approved via this adoption process. Once you have been approved, a volunteer will contact you about scheduling a time for you to meet the dog(s) you are interested in. Just because you are determined to be an approved adopter, you are NOT guaranteed a particular dog. All adoptions are first come, first served and we cannot \u0093hold\u0094 a dog based on interest alone. Our priority is placing dogs in loving homes. If you fall in love at the time of your meeting but are not ready to bring the dog home with you, a dog can be reserved for three days with a non-refundable deposit of $150. This deposit will be applied to the total adoption fee when the adoption is finalized.\nStep 7 \u0096 Finalizing The Adoption Once you have decided on the dog a volunteer will proceed with paperwork. This includes reviewing and signing an adoption agreement, vet services form, and transfer of all ownership and vetting that we have on the dog. Adoption fees must be paid by cash, money order, or bank check only. Please note, as we rescue the majority of our dogs from high-kill Southern shelters we do not know a lot about the dog\u0092s history, genetics, age, or behaviors. We are able to share information we gather based on what we learn of our dogs during their time with us and in foster homes and based on their wellness exams by veterinarians.\nStep 8 \u0096 Trip to the Vet It is recommended that you make an appointment with your vet as soon as possible after adopting a dog from our program. While every effort is made to provide the best possible care once these dogs come to us, we cannot guarantee their health. Although all of our dogs have had their basic vaccines and are dewormed monthly, some clinical signs of viruses do not show up prior to adoption. Additionally, if, at the time of adoption, your dog was not already spayed\/neutered, you would have been required to sign a spay\/neuter agreement. Our adoption contract requires all dogs to be spayed\/neutered within one month of adoption or when age appropriate. You are asked to notify us when and by who this surgery will be will be performed. Our volunteers will verify that the dog has been spayed\/neutered. If you fail to spay\/neuter, as outlined in the adoption contract you signed, our organization will take appropriate measures to take back the dog\nStep 9 \u0096 Optional Post Adoption Follow-up Visit Our adoption contract contains a clause that allows one of our volunteers or a representative the ability to perform a follow-up visit. We may require such a visit if we feel that the terms of the adoption contract are not being met. All Breed Rescue is committed to the life, health and well-being of every dog we place for the remainder of that dog\u0092s life. Should the adoption not work out or you need to rehome the dog, we require, by contract, that the dog be returned to us.performed. Our volunteers will verify that the dog has been spayed\/neutered.

Get them medical care, food and if necessary, a new home.","services":"Rescue\/Adopt, Spay\/Neuter and Support for feral\/stray cats and their caregivers","type":"Rescue","lat":40.117801666259766,"lon":-83.13590240478516,"coordinates":"40.1178, -83.1359","citystate":"Dublin, oh"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"70","attributes":{"name":"Torbie"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/70"}},{"type":"breeds","id":"437","attributes":{"name":"Extra-Toes Cat (Hemingway Polydactyl)"},"links":{"self":"\/public\/animals\/breeds\/437"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"45832755","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":3868392,"resolutionX":3456,"resolutionY":4482,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832755_3456x4482.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":60451,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":648,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832755_500x648.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4385,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":129,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832755_100x129.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2017-06-05T16:57:45Z","updated":"2017-06-05T16:58:21Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"45832549","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":6169333,"resolutionX":5184,"resolutionY":3456,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832549_5184x3456.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":34512,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":333,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832549_500x333.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2927,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":66,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832549_100x66.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2017-06-05T16:43:45Z","updated":"2017-06-05T16:58:21Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"45832548","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":8719299,"resolutionX":5184,"resolutionY":3456,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832548_5184x3456.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":48842,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":333,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832548_500x333.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2905,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":66,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832548_100x66.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2017-06-05T16:43:02Z","updated":"2017-06-05T16:58:27Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"45832546","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":7127353,"resolutionX":5184,"resolutionY":3456,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832546_5184x3456.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":44413,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":333,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832546_500x333.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2958,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":66,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832546_100x66.jpg"},"order":4,"created":"2017-06-05T16:42:25Z","updated":"2017-06-05T16:58:27Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"45832611","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":6106300,"resolutionX":5184,"resolutionY":3456,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832611_5184x3456.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":34801,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":333,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832611_500x333.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2803,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":66,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3416\/pictures\/animals\/10229\/10229289\/45832611_100x66.jpg"},"order":5,"created":"2017-06-05T16:54:14Z","updated":"2017-06-05T16:58:11Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"3416","attributes":{"name":"HOPE for Animals","street":"P.O.

PROCESS\nAdoption Applicant Requirements Include:\n\u0084X\tMust be 18 years of age or older\n\u0084X\tMust provide a valid driver\u00a1\u00a6s license or identification\n\u0084X\tMust reside in the home where the animal will be placed\n\u0084X\tApplication must be filled out by the adopter; no one is allowed to complete the application on behalf of a potential adopter. \n\u0084X\tIf the applicant rents a home, Landlord information will be required including a statement from the Landlord agreeing to allow pets.\nWhen the adopter has selected the pet they wish to adopt, they will fill out an Adoption Questionnaire.  The questionnaire will provide information about their past experience with pets, the type of pet they are looking for and also their expectations of the new pet. The purpose of the questionnaire is not to exclude them from adopting. It is simply a tool that helps the Center match people with a pet that would best fit their lifestyle and expectations.\nBefore an adoption can be approved, the following is required:  \n\u0084X\tApplicant has spent time to get acquainted with the animal they are interested in\n\u0084X\tApplicant has been interviewed by a Paws and Claws volunteer\n\u0084X\tAll family members and\/or roommates must meet the animal\n\u0084X\tIf there are other animals in the home, an introduction will be needed to assure the animals compatibility  and  documentation that the other animals are current on vaccinations and spayed  or neutered\n\u0084X\tA home check may or not be required; each adoption will vary due to the needs of the particular animal.  If a home check is required, a convenient time for all parties will be set.\n\nFINALIZING THE ADOPTION\n\u0084X\tReview the contract with the adopter.  Discuss each item in the contract and ask the adopter to initial each one.\n\u0084X\tReview Paws and Claws return policy.\n\u0084X\tReview the animal\u00a1\u00a6s medical information.\n\u0084X\tScan the animal to assure that the microchip information is correct.\n\u0084X\tObtain the Adoption Donation.\n\u0084X\tExplain Paws and Claws follow-up procedure.\n\u0084X\tHave the adopter sign and date the adoption agreement.  The Paws and Claws volunteer coordinating the adoption must sign as well.\n\u0084X\tGive the adopter a copy of the adoption agreement and the animal\u00a1\u00a6s medical records.\n\nFOLLOW-UP PROCEDURE\nAdopters do not always call the Center when they experience a problem; therefore, it is important to follow-up after the adoption to assure problems are addressed in a timely manner.  Good follow-up helps lower the return rate and maintains a successful adoption relationship.\nAdoption follow-up contacts via telephone or e-mail will be done:\n\u0084X\tThree days after the adoption,\n\u0084X\tThree weeks after the adoption, and\n\u0084X\tThree months after the adoption.\nSome important questions to ask include:\n\u0084X\tHow is the animal settling into the new routine and home?\n\u0084X\tAre there any behavioral issues that we can assist with?\n\u0084X\tHas the animals name been changed?\n\u0084X\tHow are the other pets in the home adjusting to the newest member of the family?\nAll information received from the adopter will be recorded in the animal\u00a1\u00a6s file.\n\nRETURN POLICY\nNo matter how careful the Center will be in attempting to match the right pet with the right family, there will be occasions where animals are returned to the Center.  Adoption Donations are not refundable\nAdoption Donation of $80 for dogs, $50 for cats, $100 for puppies, and $75 for kitties is requested.

Email or call us about which animal you are considering and we can make an appointment for you and the animal to meet. Visit the Adoption Information page at www.mshoogys.org to fill out our adoption application and email it to one of our volunteers. You can also print a copy, fill it out, and bring it with you to M'Shoogy's during our hours of operation, which are Saturdays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. Please note that if you are applying to adopt a dog, we usually require that you have a fenced-in yard except in special situations.\n\nThe cost to adopt is just $59 which includes shots and the cost of spaying\/neutering. If you are adopting a dog we also ask that you purchase 6 months of heartworm preventative. It is sold by weight. If you check around, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find it is the lowest cost adoption service in the area.","about":"With a strict no-kill policy, several hundred dogs, cats and other animals of all ages and sizes call M'Shoogy's home. It costs approximately $50.00 per month per animal, excluding  medicine, and approximately $500.00 per day to open the door.  In over 19 years, we have saved more than 15,000 animals from certain death.\n\nGary and Lisa Silverglat started M'Shoogy's and have given and lived a 24 hour commitment to the animals. They have had four days away from the Sanctuary in 19 years. They have never taken a salary for themselves, only given everything they have with no thought of monetary compensation.  There are also other individuals, volunteers, and employees who help provide care and love for the animals.\n\nSeveral acres in the back are also dedicated to wildlife rehabilitation. Many animals are given medical attention and food until they are old enough and\/or well enough to be reintroduced into the wild. Summer and spring brings around a large amount of raccoons and possums. Fox, owls, deer, squirrels and ducks have all called M'Shoogy's home for a little while.\n\n\nM'Shoogy's also provides educational tours and talks for groups to teach the importance of treating animals with dignity and respect.

My late husband was a veterinarian and our lifelong goal was to have a full-service facility.  A one-stop shop to find a great companion and then take great care of it throughout its life with you.  My husband passed away four years ago, but one year ago, I started our official rescue program.  We had been rescuing dogs for 15 yrs, but fully supported it ourselves.

for animals.  Located in Huddleston, VA, we are truly in the heart of Virginia \u2013 30 minutes from Lynchburg, 30 minutes from Smith Mountain Lake, 30 minutes from Bedford, and 60 minutes from Roanoke.\n\nOur motto is \u201cRescue \u2026 rehome \u2026 real love\u201d and we try to live it every day.  We rescue animals in need of new homes and loving families.  We make sure each of them is spayed or neutered and up-to-date on all routine vaccinations.  If other medical care or treatment is needed, we get that for them as well.  \n\nWe welcome them into our homes and our lives and really get to know their personalities and their needs.  Then we make it our mission to re-home them \u2026 and to place them in the forever home that will be perfect for them.  Some of them really need to have another pup companion while others will do fine being an \u2018only pet.\u2019  Some love having children to play with while others prefer being with adult people.  Some do well sharing a home with cats or other small pets while others, well \u2026 not so much.  And the only way you know this is by living with them!  \n\nWe also work to educate and encourage pet owners to spay or neuter their animals to a) help their pets lead longer, healthier lives and b) help reduce the numbers of homeless and unwanted animals in our Central Virginia communities.  It is such an easy thing to do!  Not only will it benefit your pet and your family, but it will help reduce the numbers of wonderful, adoptable animals that are euthanized every year.

completed before you will be considered for any dog or be scheduled for visits, but please feel free to come to any of our upcoming events to meet Italian Greyhounds\/Whippets during the application process.\n\n \n\nStep 1:  Your Application.  We cannot move forward without an adoption application, so please submit one by email, fax or USPS to the PO Box.  Applications can be downloaded under the Fostering and Adoption Tab of our website.  Applications received by email and fax will most likely be the first to be reviewed as the PO Box gets checked once a week.\n\nStep 2:  Reference Checks.  Yes, we do call both personal references as well as your veterinarian and ask questions.  If you are not comfortable with this or any other part of our adoption process, then please go to your local shelter and adopt a dog that would otherwise be euthanized.\n\nStep 3:  Phone Interview.  A TIGR representative will call you to discuss your application and any issues or concerns that there might be as well as talk about your lifestyle.  TIGR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal is to match the best dog with the best FOREVER home.\n\nStep 4:  Home Visit.  We will schedule a home visit at a time that is convenient for the Volunteer TIGR Representative and the applicant.  We will be inspecting the fencing as well as seeing the overall environment in which the dog would be living.  Depending on who is doing the home visit will depend on whether a dog is brought to your house at that time.  Our volunteers are spread out through the DFW area and the one closest to your area will most likely be the one that visits with you, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not always the one that has the foster dog in which you are interested.   All parties interested in adoption must be present at the time of the visit as well.\n\nStep 5:  Meeting the Dogs.  Once you have been approved, you may then begin meeting the dogs.  You will be put in touch with the foster parents and they can tell you about the daily life with that particular dog and if that foster dog would fit in with your lifestyle.  All meetings will be scheduled between the two of you.  If the first visit goes GREYT, then the second visit can be to adopt the dog.\n\nTIGR realizes that the process can be lengthy, however it is effective!  There are many IG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Whippets in loving forever homes.  The average lifespan for IG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Whippets is 12 -16 years, with some living longer.  This is a long term commitment.\n\nPlease note:  Just because you fall in love with one particular IG\/Whippet doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always mean that it is the right dog for you or your family.  TIGR volunteers are here to help you with this process and to educate you as well on each individual IG\/Whippet.\n\nOUT OF STATE ADOPTION INFORMATION\n\nWhile on occasion we will consider out of state adoptions, we always encourage local adoptions or neighboring state adoptions first as it is easier on the human as well as the potential pet.  We do not adopt out of the USA at all.\n\nTIGR as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpart\u00e2\u0080\u009d of its adoption process requires all potential adopters to have phone and a home interview.  Here is a link to our adoption process and well as applications http:\/\/txigrescue.org\/fostering-adopting\/ Home visits sometimes are impossible for us when we have out of state applicants, which is absolutely required.\n\nTIGR does let the foster home have a part in the decision making process as well (as they know the foster dog best) and some volunteers are not comfortable sending their dogs out of state.\n\nTIGR does not ship\/transport\/fly any of our foster dogs, so potential adopters are required to come to Texas to meet the dog (two meetings) to see if it is match as well as complete the adoption process.\n\nIt is our goal to make sure that each and every dog be matched with the appropriate forever home which is why each step of our adoption process is important.  While on occasion there are returns to TIGR, the adopted dog must always come back to TIGR and would have to be brought back to Texas.\n\n ","about":"TIGR, Texas Italian Greyhound Rescue INC is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit group incorporated within the State of Texas, operating in the Dallas-Ft.

We strongly advocate that animals are spayed or neutered regardless of breed, sex or age.  Our program offers spay and neuter assistance and basic veterinary treatment - including flea and parasite treatment and routine vaccinations - to needy or unowned animals.  We also provide humane education to community and civic groups on the care of animals and the importance of spaying\/neutering in population control.\nWe have a limited intake, no-kill adoption program.  Most animals are transferred from municipal animal control facilities.  All animals are in foster homes or at an off-site adoption partner site.  Animals are never euthanized for space.  At CATsNAP, our goal is to promote successful pet ownership and place animals in a loving, pet friendly home.\n","services":"spay, neuter,

Stewart's 3rd Infantry Division shipped out to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2006, the organization moved to Glenwood, Georgia. Southern Comfort fills a critical need in Wheeler County, which has no other rescues or animal control.\n\nWe specialize in physical, social and emotional rehabilitation of our rescues. All animals are examined, vaccinated, spayed or neutered and receive any and all medical treatment before being placed in carefully screened forever homes.\n\nSouthern Comfort is a \"no-kill\" rescue and only euthanizes in cases of irremediable suffering or vicious and dangerous animals.\n\nWe also work to raise public awareness of the plight of homeless animals and promote the benefits of adopting an animal in need through community outreach and education.","services":"adoptions, rescue, ","type":"Rescue","lat":32.157901763916016,"lon":-82.68280029296875,"coordinates":"32.1579,

Our contract requires that the adopted kitty be indoor only, not declawed, have a back-up microchip phone number and person, among other clauses. We conduct an interview, and watch the family interact with the kitty. If everything goes well, we ask a $125 adoption fee for kittens and $75 for cats 18 months and older. We require all members of the household to be present for the interaction so we can see how the kitty responds with each person and vice-versa, that there are no allergic reactions, and that all family members are on-board with the adoption and kitty selected.  We do this to minimize the risk of the kitty being returned and to make sure there are no allergy issues. If renting, we ask for a copy of the rental agreement showing pets are allowed, a letter from the landlord stating adopting this kitty is allowed or a phone call with the landlord will also be okay.","about":"FOSMAS is an IRS-registered 501(c)(3) charity whose primary goal is to lower the euthanasia rate at the shelter, reduce the overpopulation of homeless cats, and provide public outreach services to help the animals in surrounding communities. We can accomplish this goal by increasing adoptions and expanding our volunteer program. We provide homes, medical and comfort care to all animals in foster care until adopted.\n\nWe provide specialty services for care of pre-wean kittens, we train fosters in animal care and provide foster homes for those that choose to volunteer. FOSMAS provides all necessary food, supplies, and medical treatments for the pets it places in foster homes. We place them in adoption centers and holds pet fairs to find forever homes for the pets in our foster system.\n\n","services":" adoptions, volunteer programs, information and financial support for local spay\/neuter programs","type":"Rescue","lat":37.13059997558594,"lon":-121.65299987792969,"coordinates":"37.1306, -121.653","citystate":"Morgan Hill, CA"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"49524737","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":3295675,"resolutionX":3024,"resolutionY":4032,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7931\/pictures\/animals\/10689\/10689927\/49524737_3024x4032.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":45107,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7931\/pictures\/animals\/10689\/10689927\/49524737_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4349,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/7931\/pictures\/animals\/10689\/10689927\/49524737_100x133.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2017-09-20T19:34:57Z","updated":"2017-09-20T19:36:13Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"7931","attributes":{"name":"Tails of Hope","street":"PO Box 631","city":"Oakhurst","state":"NJ","postalcode":"07755","country":"United States","email":"adopt@tailsofhopenj.com","url":"http:\/\/tailsofhopenj.com","facebookUrl":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tailsofhopenj\/","adoptionProcess":"All potential adopters will have to complete an adoption application before they meet the animals.

Our organization is totally run by people who generously volunteer their time, homes and hearts in order to help.\nWe make a promise to any animal who comes through our doors they will never be homeless again. We hope our residents will find a loving home with a lifelong companion or a loving family; but if they never find that home, they are welcomed into our family. \nWe provide spay and neuter services and any necessary medical care for pets. We work diligently to educate the public, especially children, on the importance of pet sterilization, responsible pet ownership and the humane treatment of animals. We assist all animals in distress without regard to age, breed or ease of placement. \nWe believe that with some temporary assistance, many animals can remain in their current homes instead of being admitted to animal shelters. We help by providing temporary supplies of pet food and other supplies to families suffering from unemployment, seniors on fixed incomes and families that are dealing with chronically illnesses where resources are tightly dedicated. \nWe strive to work with area shelters and other rescue and humane organizations to develop a network of supporters and volunteers in order to create a better world for homeless pets\n","services":"adoptions, spay\/neuter\/education","type":"Rescue","lat":40.26359939575195,"lon":-74.02169799804688,"coordinates":"40.2636, -74.0217","citystate":"Oakhurst, NJ"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"39848483","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":57545,"resolutionX":600,"resolutionY":800,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/39848483_600x800.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":43386,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/39848483_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3105,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/39848483_100x133.jpg"},"order":1,"created":"2016-10-22T04:06:09Z","updated":"2016-10-22T04:06:40Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"39848484","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":85752,"resolutionX":600,"resolutionY":800,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/39848484_600x800.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":65237,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/39848484_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":4650,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/39848484_100x133.jpg"},"order":2,"created":"2016-10-22T04:06:10Z","updated":"2016-10-22T04:06:40Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"39848494","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":106619,"resolutionX":510,"resolutionY":680,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/39848494_510x680.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":43493,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":666,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/39848494_500x666.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3447,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":133,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/39848494_100x133.jpg"},"order":3,"created":"2016-10-22T04:06:47Z","updated":"2016-10-22T04:06:49Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"77382890","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":38100,"resolutionX":588,"resolutionY":483,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/77382890_588x483.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":28745,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":410,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/77382890_500x410.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":2841,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":82,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/77382890_100x82.jpg"},"order":4,"created":"2021-03-16T12:31:24Z","updated":"2021-03-16T12:31:24Z"}},{"type":"pictures","id":"77382891","attributes":{"original":{"filesize":38777,"resolutionX":545,"resolutionY":465,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/77382891_545x465.jpg"},"large":{"filesize":34344,"resolutionX":500,"resolutionY":426,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/77382891_500x426.jpg"},"small":{"filesize":3083,"resolutionX":100,"resolutionY":85,"url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/3433\/pictures\/animals\/10702\/10702636\/77382891_100x85.jpg"},"order":5,"created":"2021-03-16T12:31:34Z","updated":"2021-03-16T12:31:35Z"}},{"type":"orgs","id":"3433","attributes":{"name":"Last Chance Animal Rescue","street":"PO Box 1661","city":"Southampton","state":"NY","postalcode":"11969","country":"United States","phone":"(631) 478-6844","email":"applications@lcarescue.org","url":"www.LCARescue.org","facebookUrl":"www.facebook.com\/LCARescue","adoptionUrl":"https:\/\/www.lcarescue.org\/info\/adoption","donationUrl":"https:\/\/lcar.charityproud.org\/Give","sponsorshipUrl":"https:\/\/www.lcarescue.org\/info\/display?PageID=17234","adoptionProcess":"WELCOME to Last Chance Animal Rescue and thank you for choosing rescue!!

Application is filled out and SECURE FENCING REQUIRED FOR ALL OF OUR RESCUED DOGS.\nIf you are considering adopting a dog through HALO Here are some helpful hints:\n\nBring pictures of your yard to show secure fencing. Most of our dogs require a 6 foot fenced yard. Yards must be cleared of any fox tail weeds.\n\nWe do adopt small dogs to apartments or condo and need to see pictures of the patio or balcony area.\n\nIf you rent, please bring copy of your lease to show you can have pets and any size restrictions.\n\nWe do not adopt to homes with children under the age of five unless we know the history of the dog with young children. All Children MUST be present at adoption.\n\nIf you own a dog and are looking for a friend please bring your dog with you so they can be introduced.\n","about":"We work with this community, and with local city and county shelters rescuing cats and dogs, holding adoptions, and providing educational materials on animal care.\n\nWe are a non-profit, charitable organization.  We assist dogs and cats, and their owners in this community.\n\nPerhaps your life takes an abrupt turn. You are forced to move and must find a home for your faithful dog.  Friends and family have not been successful in helping you; Your dog has been neutered and shots are current.  You  could contact  a H.A.L.O. representative through our email: contacthalo@yahoo.com , or by calling H.A.L.O. voicemail at\n925-473-4642.  \n\nNext, we would contact you and arrange for you to bring your dog to to us to evaluate to see if he is a good fit for our adoption program. If he is, we may be able to fit him in to a foster home.  If no foster home is available we may assist you in finding a home by listing him on our site and helping you show him. We will work with you in finding a new safe and loving home for your dog.\nThis example demonstrates just one type of dilemma faced by families.

Our goal is to make the adoption process a kind, informative and rewarding experience because we believe that every animal can become a treasured family pet.","services":"adoptions, rescue,

The application should be emailed to fortheloveofbirdsnj@gmail.com. Be sure to include two personal references and a veterinary reference. We check the references and then will reach out to you to schedule a mutually convenient time to talk on the phone. After your application is approved and based on your preferences, lifestyle and bird experience we will recommend a bird(s) for you to meet. Or you can let us know if you are interested in adopting one of our available birds.\n \nFor small birds like finches and budgies, they typically can be adopted after one visit to their foster home. Medium to large parrots require at least three visits with the bird at their foster home. The reason for this is three fold. This provides the potential adopter with time to consider whether the bird is a good match with their family and life style and gives you time to get your house ready for the bird to move in. Second it gives the bird several opportunities to meet with you and get used to you. Many birds are hesitant with new people during their first visit meeting with them. And finally, it allows the foster home to watch how you interact with the bird and they can pass along information on the bird and educate the potential adopter on bird husbandry as needed. All of our adoptable birds are cared for in private foster homes throughout New Jersey. Each of our birds are treated as the unique individual that they are.\n \nPlease note that we require a waiting period of at least 6 months between bringing new birds into your home. Each bird requires a transition period to be comfortable with their new family and in their new home. Please don't short change your bird by bringing another flock member in too soon.\n \nThere is an adoption fee; fees are listed on our website. Our birds are sent home with their cage, toys and some food to get you started. Additionally, all of our birds are disease tested for Polyoma, Psitticosis and PBFD, and we will give you a copy of the test results.\n \nFor The Love of Birds holds a permit for the care and sale of exotic animals from the State of New Jersey, Division of Fish and Wildlife. All exotic birds that are not exempt in New Jersey must have a hobby permit filed with the state. We will issue you a 20 day temporary permit at the time of adoption. We must file a copy of this temporary hobby permit each year with the Division of Fish and Wildlife. You will need to file for a hobby permit during the first 20 days you have the bird. Exempt birds are budgies, cockatiels, canaries, zebra finches, rock pigeons and society finches. There are a few other exempt birds that we do not take in and offer for adoption. Additionally, all other exotic birds are required to have a band or microchip and have a hobby permit from the State of New Jersey, Division of Fish and Wildlife. YOU DO NOT NEED A SEPARATE PERMIT FOR EACH ANIMAL IN YOUR POSSESSION. If you already have a valid Individual Hobby Permit, you can add additional animals for a fee of $2.00 by writing to the Division of Fish and Wildlife or you can wait until the end of the year and list additions on your renewal form which will be sent to you.\n ","about":"For the Love of Birds is exclusively for charitable and educational purposes of companion birds through rescue, care and placement.\n \nParrots can live long lives, 20 to 80 years, and because of this and by virtue of not being a domesticated animal, they will end up living in multiple homes for various reasons; unfulfilled expectations, death, moving, loss of job, life changes, etc of caregivers. It is our mission to help as many birds as we can and find a loving and educated next home in New Jersey and surrounding areas.\n \nThe founders of For The Love of Birds are Caryn Cullen, Joanne Freel, Patty Deitsch and Kerrie Peterson. Combined, we have over 30 years involved in parrot rescue.\n\nWe are a registered 501 (c) (3) non-profit animal rescue operating in the State of New Jersey.

Foundation wants to make certain that every animal adopted goes to a loving home where it will be well cared.  Because of this, our application asks a number of detailed questions, which are necessary for our screening process.  Our application will ask you to what lengths you are willing to go, in order to accommodate the animal's needs and training. You must be able to show commitment of time, finances, energy and compassion to the animal.  \n\nOnce your application is approved, we require that you sign a contract guaranteeing non-transferal\/sale of animal, its proper care, and spay\/neuter surgery if not already done.","about":"The Marshmallow Foundation is a \u201clow kill\u201d shelter.  This is very important to all of us and we believe in it with all of our hearts.  The animals that are brought to us as \u201cstrays\u201d are held for five (5) business days.  After that hold period is up, we have the right to have that animal euthanized.  We wanted to give animals a second chance at finding new homes so we chose to have a policy where we only euthanize if there are extenuating circumstances. We do our very best to not give up on any animal brought to our doorstep! \n\nBecause we are committed to caring for these animals until we can find them appropriate homes, many are with us for a very lengthy period. On average, we have over 40 cats and 15 dogs to care for while they wait to find new homes and families. We do not give them time limits. But to do this requires support from our public.\n \nIn addition to finding homes for these pets, the Marshmallow Foundation also works closely with local and regional service dog training programs and police departments.  We are proud to have had several shelter dogs go on to help people or places in need!  \n\nThe staff and volunteers of the Marshmallow Foundation work hard every single day providing for the animals that have no other place to go.  They do this because it is in their heart and it feeds their soul.  \nPlease help them continue to care for these pets in need and provide a safe haven for them until they find new families and homes.

care homes where they have received training and socialization to help them fit into your home more quickly.\n\nThere are a few steps to set up the adoption.\n\n    Complete the PAWS4IrvingAnimalsAdoptionAppContract. You can type in the information, but must print\/sign it. You can then send it back as a PDF to PAWSforIrvingAnimalsLLC@gmail.com or fax it to 214-764-2138.  If you are meeting us at an event, you can complete the application at the event itself.\n    Schedule a home visit. After the adoption application is received, a volunteer from PAWS for Irving Animals will visit your home with the pet you are interested in adopting. We will ensure that the pet you are interested in has the opportunity to meet all the members of your immediate family, including other pets, to ensure that this adoption is a good fit.\n    Complete the 24PetWatch Change of Ownership Form. This will be used to re-program the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s microchip to you. This means that it will be much easier to return him\/her to you if he\/she is ever lost. You do NOT need to fill in the payment information. This is covered in your adoption fee. This form does not allow for typing in the data, so you will need to print it and write in the information. ou can then send it back as a PDF to PAWSforIrvingAnimalsLLC@gmail.com or fax it to 214-764-2138. Since you are adopting from a rescue, we have to submit this form on your behalf with several other documents to complete the registration process.

","about":"Saving One Life is a 501(c)3 non-profit, volunteer run, animal rescue that focuses almost completely on the animals that would have been otherwise euthanized at the pound or humane society. Our motto is that although we can't save the world, it makes a world of difference to the ones we do save. We specialize in purebred cats, feral kittens, and severe medical cases when we have funding to do so. We very rarely take owner surrender animals. \n\nWe are a no kill group and we only euthanize animals for medical issues that cannot be fixed with veterinary care (fatal illnesses, extreme prolonged suffering). We provide hospice care for animals in our care with terminal illnesses.\nAll of our animals are cared for in foster homes until they are able to go up for adoption. We may occasionally have animals in foster homes as long as four years (the running record so far) until they are adopted \u00e2\u0080\u0093 once an animal is in our rescue, we will do everything feasible to care for that animal. Our foster animals live as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpart of the family\u00e2\u0080\u009d until they are able to be put up for adoption. If we can, we will test them with cats, dogs, and children depending on who lives in the home. Not all cats get tested with kids or dogs if they are not available.\n\nAs a result of this, we really care where and how our animals are placed.

abandoned animals. We are the only no kill rescue in our community, and are the alternative to taking your dog to a high kill shelter.\n\nPriceless Puppy Rescue, Corp is dedicated to further educating the public for the need to spay and neuter your as a way to control overpopulation. All pets adopted through our organization are spayed, neutered and vaccinated prior the transfer of the animal. We fulfill the need for service hours to our local high schools, as the children are able to come and assist with the animals on a volunteer basis. We provide education to students in the responsibilities of owning a pet and help educate the public for the need to stop animal cruelty. Treating all animals in a more humane way. We feel that through this type of education we can eliminate further animals being left abused and abandoned in shelters across our
